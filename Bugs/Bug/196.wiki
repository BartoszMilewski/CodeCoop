User clicks on the install button and the download progress meeter shows up. Once the download completes the progress meter disappears
and user is presented with the same dialog and nothing happens. But the user clicked on the Install button! It looks like install means donwload and do nothing.
Clicking second time on the Install button initiates installation process.
