==Description 
I was discussing details with Bartosz over the last week regarding side
effects of shifting our hub to a new computer. I thought I'd sorted it all
out, but installing Code Co-op 5.0 beta 4 again warned as follows:

Warning: Advanced feature used.
    Your Hub ID "david@abbey.co.nz" not equal to hub transport
    (Email -> codecoop@abbey.co.nz)
    Hub ID and transport are editable through Dispatcher Settings (to edit
transport, press the Advanced button).

(etc.)

I'd already fixed this so I didn't know why I was getting another warning.

Upon further investigation, it turns out that the ConfigurationProblems.txt
file was still there from my previous installation of beta 3 (it was dated 3
November).

It appears that the installer is checking the dispatcher setup without
deleting this file first, and if there aren't any problems then the old file
remains. It is then being displayed as if there was a new problem.

I was able to confirm this by deleting the file then running the installer
again.
