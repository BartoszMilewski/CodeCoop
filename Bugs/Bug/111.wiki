==Description 

Bug #976 from the Web database.
Originaly requested by Rene Verschoor rene.verschoor@tomtom.com

I think there should be _some_ indication so the user knows he should check-in again. I've seen it happen too often that a developer has rejected changes, which remain for a long time in the check-in area without knowing it. 
==Comment
It would make sense to display red dot when there is a pending merge in a project (Sync Merge area is active).
==Resolution
We have already implemented this apporach:

 void Model::SetIncomingScriptsMarker (bool newMissing)
 {
	bool incomingScriptsPresent =
	    _history.HasIncomingOrMissingScripts () ||
	    _mailBox.HasJoinRequest () ||
	    _mailBox.HasScriptsFromFuture () ||
	    _sidetrack.HasChunks () ||
	   ''''!IsSynchAreaEmpty ()'''';
