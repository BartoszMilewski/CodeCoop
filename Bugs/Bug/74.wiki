I received an invitation but didn't click on the balloon. After a while, the following scary message appeared (together with the quarantine window). Other than that, the invitation was successfull.

==Comments
09 Oct 2006, Piotr: 1. replaced this dialog with an alert, 2. invitations are processed as first

20 Oct 2006, Bartosz: I still see the scary dialog. Processing order was OK, but after I filled out the path, the second item in the quarantine still popped up the "unknown recipient" dialog.

24 Oct 2006, Piotr: postpone execution of scripts following invitation until invitation script is fully processed and invitee enlistment created
