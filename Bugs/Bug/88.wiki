==Description 

I am not sure why the Project name and path are not showing up on one of my open dialogs. Here's a picture.

[[image:taskbar]]

I cannot duplicate this. When i switched projects, the name and path still didn't show up. When i closed this dialog and opened another, it was fine.
==Comments:
''''12-Oct-2006 Wiesiek:'''' which dialog did you minimize?

''''12-OCt-2006 Deb:'''' I had two instances of Code Co-op open. One instance shows "()" instead of the project name and path. When i tried changing projects in the instance of Code Co-op that showed "()", it didn't make a difference. Still, the project name was not displayed. Once I closed the instance of Code Co-op showing "()" and reopened another instance, the project name was displayed as expected.

''''17-Jan-2007 Wiesiek:'''' Still cannot reproduce.
