==Description 
The first run of Dispatcher posts the alert "By default Code Co-op uses e-mail for synchronization." The balloon shows together with the little dialog asking for email address.
* The dialog needs better explanation
* The alert remains in the alert area and, when the user double-clicks on the dispatcher, the main window opens rather than "Collaboration Settings".
==Proposed Solution
Instead of showing this alert, the Dispatcher on first run should not try to configure email, but rather start the config wizard.
==Notes
Implemented as proposed.
