==Description 
Currently i have a situation where I'm getting a MAPI error "Cannot initialize Mapi subsystem". Right now I am getting an open dialog EVERY TIME the dispatcher checks email. When i close the dialog, it pops back open. If i leave it open, it comes to the top of my desktop. This is hugely annoying. So, in situations like this where i have to continue working even though the dispatcher is complaining, I get bombarded by this dialog.

Why can't I close the dialog and have it be closed permanently?

If the mapi subsystem is not usable, there is no reason to use the dispatcher. You can always move the window to the side of your screen and resize it.
