==Description 
Peter von Kaenel: I wasn't receiving checkin scripts when I was disconnected from the network, and one of my changes ended up being rejected. For me it showed up as a branch in the history. The rejected files show up in the bottom half of the history window. I tried right-clicking on a file and selecting "Restore file version". This generated the assertion:

HistoricalFiles.cpp Line 724
Expression: RangeIncludesMostRecentVersion() || !fileFilter.empty()
==Resolution
Changed can ... method, so Restore File Version shows up only for scripts from the trunk.
