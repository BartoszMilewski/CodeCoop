==Description 

I am running beta 3. When i select a branched script which resulted from a conflict in the History tab, I can see the grayed out Merge Branch and Auto Merge Branch buttons in the details pane below. However, once i select one of the files, the Merge buttons disappear.

Here is the screen capture with just the branched script selected.

Here I have clicked on one of the files. You will notice that the merge options have disappeared.

This is happening on both my beta 3 installations.

This is a showstopper!
