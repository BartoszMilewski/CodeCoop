==Description 

There is a new bug in 5.1c. From the Code Co-op window select a Folder in the "Project Folders" area. Now pick and up and drag one of the files from the right-hand side to explorer or to BeyondCompare. The directory is the target of the drag-and-drop not the file as it should be.  To work around it you must deliberately select the file you want to drag. 

This bug was not present in the previous release.

== Analysis

We should probably change selection the moment we start drag and drop.
