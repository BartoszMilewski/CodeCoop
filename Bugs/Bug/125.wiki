==Description 
Differ is viewing a diff. Current file changes (e.g., a script was unpacked). Differ asks if you want to refresh. During refresh, it tries to load the "before" file, which no longer exists and throws an exception.
==Comment
Don't refresh read-only temporary files.
==Resolution
A stop-gap solution: changed the error display to "file doesn't exist any more".
