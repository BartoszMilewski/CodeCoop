==Description 
I have observed a related minor bug. I have two shortcuts which launch Code Co-op and open my main projects (using e.g. -Project_Visit 1 -GUI). On some occasions (possibly the first time Code Co-op is launched after startup), one of them ends up with the task bar just saying "Code Co-op" instead of the project name. If I switch projects then switch back again, it shows the project name as expected. 

Note: This might be serious if we are looking for co-op servers by window title.
