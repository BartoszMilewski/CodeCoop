==Description 
The user probably had his registry messed up.

| I opened the "Collaboration Settings" dialog and clicked on Email Options. I now get a different message than before: "Please specify a valid maximum size of script attachments". After clicking OK, the E-mail Options dialog opens, and I can edit the email settings. 


Note that the split size for scripts is the default 1024 KB. Even when I set it to the minimum 100 KB or to 100000 KB, I still get that message.


Also note that I only get that message when clicking on the "Email Options" button in the "Collaboration Settings" dialog. I do NOT get the message when clicking on "E-mail Options" in the context menu of the system tray.


I'm fairly certain that I never saw that message before, so that would imply that something is still a little messed up somewhere.|

Hypothesis: The user had invalid chunk size in the regitsry. The email options in collaboration settings does some strange things
* displays warning ''before'' opening the dialog
* doesn't save the correcter value

Cannot verify the above hypothesis.
