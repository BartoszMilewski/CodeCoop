==Description
In a project when I am admin and there are other members (one of them observer):
# Try defecting. This fails, because I should first nominate an admin. 
# Open Project>Members
#* Select the observer
#* Make the observer an admin (radio button available!)
Assertion in membershipchange.cpp, line 72
 Assert (_projectDb.IsProjectAdmin ()); 
I had to kill co-op and restart it. The member dialog now showed the new administrator.
==Resolution
Removed incorrect assertion. During a sequence of membership changes I can loose membership priviledge, but still generate scripts changing other members (under the same transaction during which I've lost admin status).
