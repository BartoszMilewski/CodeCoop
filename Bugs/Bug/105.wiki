==Description 

Bug #1194 from the Web database.
Original source Joe Calkins.

How can you get a notification when someone joins a project? We have the 
server as admin with auto accept ON so we can easily 
join a project. But... it would be nice to know when someone does that.... 
if I recall correctly, coop used to hit all other members 
with a message when someone else joined.

|4/12/2005|Bartek|Maybe we should implement "Notification Area" in Code Co-op, where we could put events of interest to the client--in particular error messages. The would have to be persistent, of course. That would solve the problem of logging asynchronous "alerts" (a la Dispatcher).|
