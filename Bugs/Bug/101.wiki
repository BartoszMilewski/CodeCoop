==Description 

Bug #1225 from the WEB database.

This is the first time i've noticed this. I just got a script in from Piotr that did not get automatically synched even though i have set my project option to Auto-synch. I had to go in and manually unpack the message from the mailbox tab and then process the synch script. i'll send diagnostics on this project.
