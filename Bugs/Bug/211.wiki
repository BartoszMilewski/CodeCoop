==Description 
From Dave Calkins:

I multi-selected 3 directories (which were not part of the project) and used right-click >> add to project.

It showed the first dialog listing the types of files to add, I clicked Select All and then OK.

It then showed me the second dialog (I think it does one for each top level directory which was selected).  At this point, I changed my mind and cancelled it and the next dialog.

The files from the first dialog (and the first top level directory which was selected) were added and shown in the check out area.

I drag selected them all and did an uncheckout.

I then got the below error.

Transformer.cpp line 666, 

 parentState.isCheckedIn() 
 || parentState.IsRelevantIn (Area::Original) 
 || (is Virtual && parentState.IsNone()

==Resolution
The assumption was too strong. It's okay to uncheckout folders before children.
