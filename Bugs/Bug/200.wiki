==Description 
I have a file checked out on my laptop, but it doesn't show as checked out on my desktop. Out of curiosity, I tried to look at its properties on the desktop. I got the assertion:
| CheckoutNotifications.cpp: line 158 |
Stack trace:
 CheckOut::Db::RefreshIndex
 CheckOut::Db::Sequencer::Sequencer
 FileProps::AddCheckoutNotifications
 Model::GetFileProps (gid = 1f-4b) that's in Rebeca
 Commander::Selection_Properties
The array _notes is empty. It turns out this happens on every file.
==Resolution
Removed over-eager assertion.
