==Description 
There are several keyboard shortcuts that involve interaction between the browser control and the rest of the program--for instance backspace Ctrl-D (select text in the address bar), etc. These shortcuts are currently ignored. When the browser has focus, its accelerator is switched on, and the co-op accelerator is disabled. Probably both of them should be enabled in the message loop. Or, there should be a way to register our shortcut handler with the browser control.
