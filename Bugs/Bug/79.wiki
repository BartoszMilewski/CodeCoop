==Description 
Here is a step-by-step tutorial on how to crash co-op 5 beta 1 ;)
* Create a dummy project
* Do dummy check-in (optional)
* Create a branch of your project
* Go back to your original project, and from the project menu select 'Merge with Branch Project'
* In the Target Project combo, select your branch
* Boom, assertion failure. My guess is an attempt to access an element in an empty std::vector. Sure you'll have no problem fixing this one ;)
==Comment
Cannot reproduce with build after script 3f-48a.
