==Description 

Bug #890 from the Web database.
Originaly reported by Peter Verswyvelen pverswyvelen@playlogic.com

It would be handy if the "STATUS.EXE -a" command line would return the status of all directories, not only all files. 

---
The STATUS.EXE command line tool does not seem to report files that are deleted and which much be checked in. 

How can we find out which files are removed and deleted from the project? 

We need this because we have our own GUI client that calls CHECKIN.EXE, passing all the files that must be checked in.

|9/21/2004|Wiesiek|Add private Code Co-op method that will return a absolute path list of all deleted project files/folders.|
