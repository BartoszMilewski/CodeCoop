==Description 
Also, as a side issue-the drop-down menu for the Target Project in the merge view doesn't accommodate long project names-all of my projects begin with a common string that is 15 characters long, and when I see them in the drop-down I can't differentiate them, and have to use the &lt;Select Branch> choice to see the full names. Just a minor thing…
==Resolution
Increased the width of select target drop down from 120 to 150 pixels.
