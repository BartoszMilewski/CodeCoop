==Description 

Currently, if you try to install Code Co-op without defecting from all projects, you get a dialog warning you that this is the case. You are given the option to continue with the uninstall. When I say "YES, i want to uninstall", it fails. There isn't a warning. Code Co-op just doesn't uninstall.
