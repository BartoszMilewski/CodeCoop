Assertion:
 _model.AllIncomingScriptsAreUnpacked ()
was hit in Commander.cpp. After than, the remaining scripts in the project inbox were not processed. The scripts were probably copied during the processing of a background call from the Dispatcher. It happend in the project ''CSS RSWeb'', which is in auto-synch.
| Conditions? Code Co-op was open to my CSS RSWeb project. It’s window was below Dreamweaver which I have at full screen. I was working on files that are already checked out in Dreamweaver. |
