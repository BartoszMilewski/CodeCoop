==Description 
When using CommandExec to post commands during another command execution, occasionally the command is eaten. This happens when the first command displays a dialog (or a beginner's tip). The message is picked up, but it's not executed because the re-entrance lock is still closed.

This is the reason why the browser doesn't appear when creating a new project that already has index.wiki (reported by dempson).

==Proposal
Check if the lock is taken. If so, don't take the command off the command stack. Instead add code after a command is executed (end of MenuCommand?) to look at the command stack and execute pending commands.
