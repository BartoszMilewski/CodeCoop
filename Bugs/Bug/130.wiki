==Description 
Ivan Vecerina: Double-clicking a line in the history view will open one of the affected 
files.

This is unexpected and unsettling.
The "Open" option just doesn't make sense anymore (neither in the 
right-click pop-up menu),
since the scripts are automatically opened in the details pane.
Just get rid of it, and maybe use Details as a default ?
==Comment
Did somebody else complain about it? Or was it Ivan only? I'm still not sure what to do.

The best solution would be to check if the script modified only one single file. In that case, open it. Otherwise show script details.
