==Description 

When performing a merge on a file that has only moved, both merge options are available -- colored. What's confusing is that the Auto-merge option does not do anything when the only thing that has changed is the file has moved. The GUI would be clearer if we disabled (grayed) the auto-merge button in situations like this where the auto-merge does nothing.
