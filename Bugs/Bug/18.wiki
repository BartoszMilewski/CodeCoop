| Description | I tried sending an invitation from my satellite to my hub. 

Here is the filled out dialog. 
[[Image:Invitation dialog]] 

The dispatcher pops up a balloon stating "Rejected invitation". When i double-click on the balloon i get the following dialog:

[[Image:Rejected Invitation]]

I did try entering my hub's computer name as the "New Member Name" even though this isn't asked for. I still get the same rejection.
