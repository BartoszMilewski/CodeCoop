==Description 
This client had problems with Exchange unable to provide user address through Outlook. But it worked with 4.6! It looks like 5.0 is too strict.

| I am able to create only one outlook e-mail account. 
However I compared with some of my colleagues. They have tried 5.0 and 5.0b, but due to problems with connection they decided to use 4.6e. I did the same, and now it all works fine with me!! |
