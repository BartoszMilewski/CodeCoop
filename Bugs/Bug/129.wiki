==Description 
Ivan Vecerina: Right click on details of incoming script => ASSERT failure & Crash if ignored
 Assertion info:
   Program: C:\Program Files\Reliable Software\Code Co-op\Co-op.exe
   File: .\UI\Layout.cpp
   Line: 826
   Expression: iter != _panes.end ()

Reproduced as follows:

In the Inbox tab, I have an incoming script.
'''right'''-clicking on any file in the details pane appears to trigger the 
failure.
==Resolution
Corrected couple of can_ ... methods that validated selection menu items displayed in the context menu. Some of can_ methods used tables not displayed in the mailbox view. Fix in Beta2.
