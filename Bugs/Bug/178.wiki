==Description 
I used the config wizard to change configuration from the default (use Outlook Express) to SMTP/POP3. Everything went smoothly, but when I next looked at the configuration through E-mail Options menu, I noticed that, under POP3 settings, the default was "This account is shared between co-op and my email program". I think the default should be "used only by Co-op", since we tell people to use a dedicated account for SMTP/POP3.
==Resolution
Pop3Account constructor defaults to the Code Co-op dedicated e-mail account.
