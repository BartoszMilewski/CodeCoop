==Description 

I had a file checked out and unedited when an incoming sync came in. The incoming sync affected this unedited file. I decided to make additional changes to this file before merging the incoming changes. 

When i edited the file by double-clicking it in the Check-in Area, the changes were highlighted in the differ. However, if i closed and reopened the file after making edits, the changes are no longer highlighted. The do appear in the left pane-Current tab. 

If changes are made outside of Code Co-op, the changes are displayed in the Current tab but they are not highlighted.

I would have expected the changes to be either highlighted in the left pane-Current tab or for the changes to appear highlighted in the right pane. To me, showing them in the right pane makes the most sense.
