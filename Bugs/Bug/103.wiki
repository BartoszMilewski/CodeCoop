==Description 

Bug #1210 from the WEB database.

Feedback during full-sync execution is bad. There are long pauses without any feedback, the messages displayed in progress boxes are not intuitive (for instance: merging), the title says "unpacking" instead of "executing", the beginner tip is inappropriate.

==Resolution
Added more feedback. Cleaned up progress meter dialog creation.
