==Description (reported by bithika [bithika.mookherjee@gmail.com]) 
I'm using the evaluation version of Code Co-op Lite 5.0f with Visual Studio 2005 version 8.0.5.

I have bound a Visual Solution, containing a Visual C++ project to a Code Co-op project,
according to the instructions given in help and also elsewhere on the relisoft forum. 

When I edit a file it checks out successfully, but doing 'Undo' checkout from Visual Studio causes Code Co-op to freeze.
I get a message box in Visual Studio saying that the 'Undo' operation failed. 

I don't think the undo operation did fail however, as when I reopen  Code Co-op there is nothing in the check-in area.

==Notes
''''Wiesiek:'''' I was able reproduce this problem once. I was running debug version of 5.0f. However, after turning on debug logging and using Debug Monitor the problem didn't reproduce.
