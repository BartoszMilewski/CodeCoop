==Description 
I have two projects. There is a file foo.txt in both (not necessarily identical). I drag this file from one project to another. The target is checked out and overwritten as expected. However the file is left r/o, so I can't edit it.
==Resolution
After copying droped files to the target project make sure that all dropped files don't have the read-only attribute.
