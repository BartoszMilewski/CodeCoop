==Description 
When windows password changes, we are not able to decrypt the user's SMTP/POP3 password and the dispatcher dies. 
Solution: Catch the exception when decrypting password from registry, show dialog which explains that:
 Code Co-op could failed to decrypt the stored e-mail account password (you probably changed your Windows login). Please provide your password for the account:

 E-mail address:
 User Name: 
 POP3 password: [    ]
 o My SMTP account requires a password too:
    o Same as POP3
    o Different: [    ]

When the password is provided, store it in the registry as usual.
