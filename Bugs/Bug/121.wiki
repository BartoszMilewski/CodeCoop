==Description 

Bug #654 from the Web database.

This is a long time request, which other Co-op users I know also miss. In spite of the tabbed file view and other enhancements, explorer.exe will always be needed for various reasons (e.g. rename/replace/copy files independently of co-op, view thumbnails of files/pictures that are in the folder, etc...). 
Suggestions: 
- A menu and keyboard shortcut would be nice 
- The viewed project sub-path is currently displayed at the top of the Co-op window. What about launching explorer.exe with it when this displayed path is 
double-clicked ? (when in the project root, display instead of 
the path, rather than hiding the text widget). 
- Allow right-click in the tree view, have an "Explore" command in the pop-up menu.
