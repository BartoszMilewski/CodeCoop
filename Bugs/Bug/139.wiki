==Description 
I was in the branch merge view, merging with another project (this might be important). I selected Defect from the Project menu. I defected and was brought into Project view, but the view was empty. Even hitting the Refresh button didn't do anything. I had to close co-op.
==Resolution
When destroying current layout first deactivate it, so all its visual element disappear from the screen.
