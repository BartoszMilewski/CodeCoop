| Summary     | checkout applet does not work with incorrect path |

| Component   | Code Co-op |
| Version     | 4.6e and 5.0 |

==Description
Invoke the following command line checkout "project\root\folder". 
(I know that the syntax is incorrect). 

In response in the release version I get: Error: Internal error: database 
corrupted -- invalid global file id fff-fffff. The message is not true 
and also it is scary.

The question is also whether we can change checkout behaviour a bit.
If a user specifies a project root folder than the default action is All_DeepCheckOut.

==Resolution
*Fixed the FileSeq class Open method to take into account error ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND, so when the user specifies malformed path the file sequncer is at end. This prevents passing malformed paths to Code Co-op.
*Suggestion not impelemented.
