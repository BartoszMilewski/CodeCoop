==Description 

If you export a file from the history via "Save Selected Files", the dialog remembers where you last saved a file to (which is good).

But, if you change the selected from "before selected script" to "after selected script", the "save to folder" path gets cleared and you need to reselect this. I do not think this should be cleared.

There may be other similar places this happens, I haven't tested exhaustively.
