<h1>How do I back-up the projects on my machine?</h1> 

<br /> 
<p class="first">The <em>\co-op</em> directory on your largest drive contains the databases for all your project (that's the default during setup). Back up this folder and its contents.  You might also want to back-up your project files, even though it is not strictly necessary. 
</p>
<p>If you don't want to back up your project files, make sure that your history is in good order--try selecting the earliest script and do <em>Selection &gt; Export Version</em>. If it fails, some of the files in your history might not be recoverable and you won't be able to restore them based purely on history.</p>

<br />&nbsp;<br />

<h1>Restoring a project from your database files</h1>
<br />
<p class="first">After you reinstall Code Co-op, copy the folders contained in the back-up \co-op folder to the new \co-op folder on your machine. Restore project files from the same backup using exactly the same paths as the original. To be on the safe side, launch Code Co-op and run <em> Project &gt; Repair</em> for each project. </p>
<p>If you haven't backed up project files, <em>Project &gt; Repair</em> will restore them using your project's history (this is why you have to be positive that your history is not corrupt). If your project is large, this may take a bit of time.</p>
