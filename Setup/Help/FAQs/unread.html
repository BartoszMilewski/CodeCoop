			<h1>Why won't the dispatcher recognize the incoming script in my email Inbox?</h1>
			<br />

			<p class="first">The solution to this can be quite simple. In order for the Dispatcher to 
			recognize the email message sitting in your email Inbox, it must be marked as 
			&quot;unread&quot;. For example, in Outlook Express an unread message is bold. Once it is 
			&quot;read&quot;, it will no longer be bold. If you inadvertently &quot;read&quot; the message, go 
			to Outlook and select edit from the tool bar and then select &quot;mark as unread&quot;. 
			From the Dispatcher select &quot;Get Mail&quot;. The script should be recognized and 
			routed appropriately.</p>

			<p>Other cause of Dispatcher not picking up incoming Code Co-op scripts may 
			be that your email program is not set as the default email program. This 
			may happen if you have more than one email programs installed. Dispatcher 
			always communicates with the default email client and retrieves all 
			incoming messages from its Inbox. You need to make sure that the email 
			client that you want to use with Code Co-op is set as the default. See how to <a href="default.html">
				Set up your default email client program.</a>
