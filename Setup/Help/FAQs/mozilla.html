<h1>Why won't Mozilla Thunderbird work with Code Co-op?</h1>
<p class="first">Mozilla has implemented only the send 
	part of Simple MAPI (this is why you can send e-mail from Word). The receiving 
	part is not implemented and we cannot lookup incoming messages containing 
	synchronization scripts. So, you can use it with Code Co-op Dispatcher but only 
	for sending your scripts. Receiving scripts from others has to be done manually 
	-- open the email message and double-click on the script. It will be 
	automatically uncompressed and routed to the appropriate project.</p>
<p class="first">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="first">We suggest moving to POP3/SMTP support. You can use Gmail which is a free email account that supports this protocol. </p>
