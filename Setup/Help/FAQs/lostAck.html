<h1>Do lost ACK scripts causes a problem within Code Co-op?</h1>

<br /> 


<p class="first">Occasional loss of acknowledgment scripts does not impair the working of the system. It only temporarily lengthens the lineage list sent with every script. Eventually, when a new version is voted in, the lineages shrink back to normal.</p>
<p>Acknowledgments work like this: every voting member, after receiving a script, produces an acknowledgment addressed to the script's creator. After collecting all the acknowledgments, the creator sends one more final ack to everybody, thus blessing the version as &quot;Confirmed&quot;.</p>
<p>A lineage of a script is the list of tentative versions upon which this script depends, ending with a confirmed version, whose acceptance has been confirmed by everybody.</p>
