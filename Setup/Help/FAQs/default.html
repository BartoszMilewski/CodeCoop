		<h1>Setting your email program as the default email client</h1>
 
		<br />
		<p class="first">If you have multiple email clients on your computer, you need to make sure that 
			the email client that you want to use with Code Co-op is set as the default. 
			There are a few ways how this may be done.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p class="first">First try the easiest way: launch your email client. Most of them (e.g. Outlook, 
			Outlook Express, Eudora, Netscape) perform a check at startup to see whether 
			they are set as default. If not, they propose to make them default.
		</p>
		<p>If nothing like this happens you need to find an option in your email program 
			that makes it the default. For instance, in Outlook Express, go to 
			Tools.Options dialog and select <em>Make Default</em> at the bottom of the <b>General</b>
			page.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p class="first">Alternatively, <strong>Internet Explorer users</strong> can launch IE and select 
			Tools &gt; Internet Options. Select the Programs Tab and verify that the 
			correct email client is selected.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>Regardless of the email program there is always an option to change the default 
			email client through <b>Control Panel</b>. Select Internet Options &gt;  
			Programs tab and select your favourite email client from the list.
