<h1>How can I use Code Co-op with Macromedia HomeSite?</h1>
<p>HomeSite, like many other applications, supports the SCC interface. Follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create (or join) a Code Co-op project on your local machine. It should contain your HTML files as well as images and other resources </li>
        
<li>Create a project in HomeSite with the same root as your Code Co-op Project </li>
        
<li>Right-click on the root of the project, select &quot;Choose Source Control Provider&quot; from the context menu--select Code Co-op </li>

</p>
        
<li>Right-click again and select &quot;Map Project to Source Control&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p class="first">That's it. Next time you try to open a file in this project, HomeSite will ask you if you want to check it out. If you are planning to edit the file, click &quot;Yes.&quot; </p>
