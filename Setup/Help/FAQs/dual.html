<h1>Can I run the same project on a dual boot system?</h1>

<br />
<p class="first">First install co-op under one OS. If you already have, and are enlisted in projects, don't change anything. Switch to the other system, install code co-op there, pointing it to the same database directory (which should be the default anyway). As long as your disk has the same drive letter and directory structure on both systems, it will work. </p>
