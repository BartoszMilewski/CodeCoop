<h1>What if I'm going on a vacation, or the Admin left for a vacation?</h1>
<br /> 
<p>If a member of the project wants to go on vacation, he or she should change their status to <em>Observer</em>. This way nobody will be waiting for the acknowledgment scripts from that person. Missing acknowledgments result in <i>unconfirmed scripts</i> in the History.</p>

<p> After coming back from vacation, he or she will have to execute and accept a whole bunch of scripts, and then change the status back to <em>Voting member</em>. (All this status changing is done through the <em>Members</em> dialog in the <em>Project</em> menu.) The change from Observer back to Voting member requires verification from another project member to prevent conflicts. A verification request is sent to somebody, and check-ins by the ex-Observer are temporarily suspended.</p>

<p>What if somebody forgot to change their status? --The administrator can change it for them. What if the administrator left for vacation? --You have to invoke the <b>emergency administrator election</b>. Look for it under <em>Administrator</em> in the <em>Project</em> menu.</p>
