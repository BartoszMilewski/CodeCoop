<h1>Why can't I connect to Code Co-op from Visual Studio 6.0?</h1>
<br />
<p class="first">Visual C/C++ 6.0 has problems with the workspace file (*.dsw) and option file (*.opt). Therefore, if you are experiencing a long loading period, Microsoft suggests deleting *.dsw file and *.opt file. Also, when Visual C/C++ reports that it cannot connect to the source code control provider,  deleting *.dsw file usually helps. After making the deletion, create a new empty workspace and add your projects to it. </p>
