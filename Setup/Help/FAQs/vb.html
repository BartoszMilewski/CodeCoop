<h1>How do I integrate Visual Basic 6.0 with Code Co-op?</h1>

<br /> 
<p class="first">First of 
all, check to see if Code Co-op is recognized by VB. Go to Tools &gt; Code  Co-op &gt;  Check-out.
</p><br />
  
<h3>If Code Co-op is not listed:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Close Visual Basic and edit your vbaddin.ini which is located in the Windows directory. Add the following entry under [Add-Ins32]: <em>vbscc=3</em>. Save the file. If you do not have this file, create and save it in your Windows directory.</li>
</ul>	  
	  
<h3>If you see the Code Co-op menu item, yet cannot view the files do the following:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Locate your VB project. Let's say it is located 
        in the folder 'c:\VBProject'. </li>
        

<li>Run Code Co-op and select Project&gt;New. </li>
        
<li>Give it any name you want and, in the '<em>Where to find or create the project tree</em>' edit 
        box, place 'c:\VBProject'. Code Co-op will ask you which files you want 
        to add to the project -- you may add *.vbp files as 'Other text', *.frm 
        as 'Binary' and source code files as 'Source'. </li>
        
<li>Run VB and open the project located in the 'c:\VBProject' folder. VB will ask you if you want to add this project to Code Co-op -- answer yes. You will be presented with a list of files that VB wants to add to Code Co-op -- accept it. Now VB project is connected to Code Co-op project and inTools&gt;Code Co-op menu you will see Check out and Check in items.</li>
</ul>
