<h1>Can I set up my Hub to run unattended?</h1>

<br />
 
<p class="first">There are a couple scenarios under which this would apply. Both, of course, require that Code Co-op be installed on the machine.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Hub is only used to transport scripts. It is not a member of any project.</strong> In this situation, 
  there is nothing to configure other than designating the machine as a Hub. As long as there are no unrecoverable addressing errors, the Hub will not require any human intervention. When network connections go down, the Hub will automatically keep retrying until the connections are back.</li>
  

<li><strong>Your Hub is a member of some projects for backup purposes:</strong> The Hub should be set up as an observer in each project. Also, set the 
  <em>Project &gt; Options</em> to automatically execute and sync all scripts. (see <a href="../Help/autoMode.html">Auto-Sync mode</a>)
. Your projects will be automatically kept in sync and you'll be able to back them up regularly. </li>

</ul>
