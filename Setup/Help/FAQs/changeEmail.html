<h1>How do I change my email address within Code Co-op?</h1>
<h2>Email Peer configuration</h2>
<p>Click on the dispatcher icon and select <em>Collaboration Settings</em> and change the &quot;My email address&quot; field. Click on &quot;<em>Email Options</em>&quot; to update your POP3/SMTP settings if applicable. </p>
 <h2>LAN configuration </h2>
The only computer that needs to be changed in a hub/network configuration is the Hub. On the Hub machine, click on the dispatcher icon and select <em>Collaboration Settings. </em>Modify <em>&quot;This Hub's email address&quot;. </em>
 Click on &quot;<em>Email Options</em>&quot; to update your POP3/SMTP settings if applicable.
<p>After this change, you have to visit all projects at least once for the new email address to propagate to all other project members. You will be asked each time if you want to switch the project to the new email address--you should accept the change.</p>
