<h1>Can I use AOL, Yahoo, Gmail, Hotmail, or other free email accounts with Code Co-op?</h1>
<br />
<p class="first">You can use almost any type of email account with Code Co-op. As of version 5.0, you can now connection directly to your email account through POP3/SMTP. Most email accounts  support this protocol, but only some provide this free of charge. </p>
<p>Here is a list of the  email accounts we're aware of that support this protocol. </p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo have free SMTP/POP support</strong>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Gmail</strong> - Gmail support is built-in. See our <a href="../Tutorial/WizardStart.html">tutorial</a> for set-up instructions.</li>
			<li><strong>Hotmail</strong> (Windows Live)- Configure <a href="../Tutorial/emailLive.html">SMTP/POP3 to use Hotmail</a>.</li>
			<li><strong>Yahoo</strong> - In order to gain access to Yahoo through SMTP/POP, you will need to install <a href="http://www.ypopsemail.com/" target="_blank">YPOPS</a>. YPOPS is an open source project application. See our page on <a href="../Help/yahoo.html">Setting Up Yahoo</a> </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>AOL SMTP/POP support requires purchase</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>AOL - There are two products which will give you SMTP/POP support with AOL: <a href="http://www.email2pop.com/" target="_blank">Email2Pop</a> and <a href="http://www.enetbot.com/" target="_blank">eNetBot</a>. The cost for either of these is quite modest at under $20.</li>
