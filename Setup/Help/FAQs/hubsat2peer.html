<h1>How do I switch from a Hub-Satellite configuration to E-mail Peer configuration?</h1>
<br />
<p class="first">If you are configured on LAN as a hub with some satellites, a common scenario is to switch to pure e-mail configuration.
Also a very common case is to switch a single satellite to an e-mail peer.
Here are the steps to perform:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On a satellite</strong>: 
        just switch to E-mail Peer via Collaboration Settings sheet and enter an independent e-mail address as your hub id. The satellite will automatically take care of updating addressing table on the hub. You just have to visit each project on a newly created e-mail peer. No further action is required on your hub.</li>
        
<li><strong>On the hub</strong>: 
        when there are no more satellites connected to this hub, switch to an e-mail peer. You can preserve the e-mail address specified as the hub id.</li>
</ul>
