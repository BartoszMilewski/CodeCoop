<h1>Why am I getting access denied to the shared folder on my XP machine?</h1>
<br />
<p class="first">Windows XP will automatically set up file sharing, however it doesn't always work perfectly. To fix the access denied, turn off sharing and then turn it back on. The folder PublicInbox in the co-op database directory (usually c:\co-op) should be shared as CODECOOP (it shows on the network as \\MACHINENAME\CODECOOP). </p>
