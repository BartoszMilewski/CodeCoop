<h1>Does Code Co-op support sub-projects?</h1>
<br />

<p class="first">Code Co-op doesn't support sub-projects yet (it's on out to-do list). Instead, create a parent directory which will contain a sub-directory for each of your desired &quot;sub-projects&quot;. Set up a separate co-op project for each &quot;sub-project&quot; in its corresponing sub-directory. Note: Do not create a project with the parent directory as its root!</p>
<p>Ask new members to create a similar tree structure and join each of the projects separately, selecting the correct subdirectories as their roots.</p>
