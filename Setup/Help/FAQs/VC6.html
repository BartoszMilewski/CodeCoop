<h1>Visual C++ 6.0 Source Control Settings</h1>
<a name="Settings"></a>
<p class="first">To improve how Visual C++ 6.0 and Code Co-op work together, you can modify 
	Visual C++ 6.0's's Source Control options. In Visual C++ 6.0, click on the <b>Tools</b> menu and select <b>Options</b>. In the Options dialog, click on <b> Source&nbsp;Control</b> tab. You'll see several options.</p>
<br />
<p class="first">Here are our recommendations for Visual C++ 6.0 Source Control options:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Check</b> <em>&quot;Check out source file(s) when edited&quot; </em>Since Code 
		Co-op works without a server, you don't need to be connected to a network to 
		check out files. You can always check out your files, because you always have 
		them with you.</li>
	<li><b>Uncheck</b> <em>&quot;Check in files when closing the workspace&quot;</em> You'll 
		likely want more control over when you check in files, since checking in will 
		make your changes visible to other project members. An exception would be if 
		you're the only member of a project and you want to checkpoint your work in 
		Code Co-op every time you close the solution.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Putting Visual C++ 6.0 Workspaces and Projects under version control</h2>
<p class="first">If you have an <b>existing Visual C++ 6.0 Workspace</b>, here's how to 
	associate it with a Code Co-op project.</p>
<p>Let's say the workspace file for your project is in <em>c:\work\projects\KillerApp\KillerApp.dsw</em></p>
<ol>
	<li>In Code Co-op, create a new project (via the <b>Project</b> menu). For the 	project location (&quot;Where to find or create&nbsp; the project&quot;), enter a the directory that contains the workspace file.  In our case, that would be<em> c:\work\projects\KillerApp</em>
		<ul style="list-style:circle">
			<li>You can choose any directory along the path (e.g. <em>c:\work\projects</em> or<em> c:\work </em>would also be acceptable), depending on how many directories you want your Code Co-op project to cover. <strong>Note</strong> that in this version of Code Co-op, 
				projects cannot overlap.</li>
			<li>Enter the rest of the information in the New Project dialog and click OK.</li>
			<li>Code Co-op will offer to add selected project files to the project. Since 
				we'll let Visual C++ 6.0 add the files for us, click Cancel. You've now 
				created a Code Co-op project that has no checked in files.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Open the workspace in Visual C++ 6.0 (an easy way to do this within Code Co-op is to right click on the <em>.dsw</em> file and select <b>Open with Shell</b>.
		<ul>
			<li>In the Visual C++ 6.0 Workspace window (press Alt-0 if you don't see it), right click on the top 
				Workspace item and select <b>Add to Source 
				Control</b>. Visual C++ 6.0 adds the workspace file to the Code Co-op 
				project.</li>
			<li>Still in Visual C++ 6.0, again in the Workspace window, right click on each 
				project item and select <b>Add to Source 
				Control</b>. Visual C++ 6.0 adds the project files to the Code Co-op 
				project.</li>
			<li>Close the workspace in Visual C++ 6.0.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p class="first">In Code Co-op, click on the <b>Check In Area </b>tab and you'll see all 
			the newly added files. Click on the <b>All</b> menu menu item and select <b> Check In</b>. Enter a comment (e.g. <em>First versions</em>), and click OK. All 
			workspace and project files are now checked in to the Code Co-op project.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p class="first">Your Visual C++ 6.0 workspace is now fully integrated with your Code Co-op 
	project. You can open the workspace in Visual C++ 6.0 and get to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="Projects"></a>
<h2>Putting additional Visual C++ 6.0 projects under version control</h2>
<p class="first">After your Visual C++ 6.0 workspace is under version control, you might <b>add 
	new Visual C++ 6.0 projects to your workspace</b>. To add these projects to your Code Co-op 
	project, it's simplest to let Visual C++ 6.0 add it for you. And to make it 
	easy to see which files are being added and changed, it's best not to have other 
	files in the project checked out when you are adding a new project to version 
	control.</p>
<ol>
	<li>In Visual C++ 6.0, open your workspace and in the workspace window right 
		click on the project you want to add to source control. Select <b>Add to Source 
		Control</b>. Visual C++ 6.0 adds the project files to the Code Co-op 
		project.</li>
	<li>Now close the workspace in Visual C++ 6.0.</li>
	<li>In Code Co-op, click on the <b>Check In Area </b>tab and you'll see all 
		the newly added files. Select the Click on the <b>All</b> menu menu item and 
		select <b>Check In</b>. Enter a comment (e.g. <em>New sub-project</em>), and click 
		OK. The files are now checked in to the Code Co-op project.</li>
</ol>
<p class="first">Your new Visual C++ 6.0 project is now fully integrated with your Code 
	Co-op project. You can open the workspace in Visual C++ 6.0 and get to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="NewWorkspace"></a>
<h2>Putting a new Visual C++ 6.0 Workspace under version control</h2>
<p>If you are going to create a <b>new Visual C++ 6.0 Workspace</b>, here's how 
	to associate it with a Code Co-op project.</p>
<p>Let's say you plan to create your new Visual C++ 6.0 Workspace in the 
	directory <em>c:\work\projects\NextApp</em></p>
<ol>
	<li>If you don't already have a Code Co-op project that covers <em> c:\work\projects\NextApp</em>, create one (via the <b>Project</b> menu). For the 
		project location (&quot;Where to find or create&nbsp;the project&quot;), enter a the 
		directory that will contain the workspace file. Note, in our case, that would be<em> c:\work\projects\NextApp</em>
		<ul>
			<li>You can choose any directory along the path (e.g. <em>c:\work\projects</em> or<em> c:\work </em>would also be acceptable), depending on how many directories you 
				want your Code Co-op project to cover. Note that in this version of Code Co-op, 
				projects cannot overlap.</li>
			<li>Enter the rest of the information in the New Project dialog and click OK.</li>
			<li>Code Co-op will offer to add selected project files to the project. Since 
				we'll let Visual C++ 6.0 add the files for us, click Cancel. You've now 
				created a Code Co-op project that has no checked in files.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>In Visual C++ 6.0 create a new Workspace, and enter the location you selected above (e.g. <em>c:\work\projects\NextApp </em>). When Visual C++ 6.0 creates your workspace and project, it will ask you if you want to put the newly created project under source code control. Click Yes.</li>
	<li>Visual C++ 6.0 will show you the files it will add. Click OK.</li>
	<li>Now close the workspace in Visual C++ 6.0</li>
	<li>In Code Co-op, click on the <b>Check In Area </b>tab and you'll see all the newly added files. Click on the <b>All</b> menu menu item and select <b> Check In</b>. Enter a comment (e.g. <em>First versions</em>), and click OK. All solution files are now checked in to the Code Co-op project.</li>
</ol>
<p class="first">Your Visual C++ 6.0 workspace is now fully integrated with your Code Co-op 
	project. You can open the workspace in Visual C++ 6.0 and get to work.</p>
