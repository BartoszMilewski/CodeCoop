<h1>Working with Visual Studio.NET</h1>
<a name="Projects"></a>
<br />

<h2>Putting additional Visual Studio.NET projects under Code Co-op
	control</h2>
<br />
After your Visual Studio.NET solution is under version control, you might add 
		new Visual Studio.NET projects to it. To add these projects to your Code Co-op 
		project, it's simplest to let Visual Studio.NET add it for you. And to make it 
		easy to see which files are being added and changed, it's best not to have 
		other files in the project checked out when you are adding a new project to 
		version control.
<ul>
	<li> In Visual Studio.NET, open your solution and in the Solution Explorer click on 
		the project you want to add to source control. Now click on the <b>File</b> menu, 
		select <b>Source Control</b>, and further select <b>Add Selected Projects to Source 
		Control</b>.</li>
	<li> close the solution in Visual Studio.NET</li>
	<li> In Code Co-op, click on the <b>Check In Area </b>tab and you'll see all the 
		newly added files. Select the Click on the <b>All</b> menu menu item and select <b>Check 
		In</b>. Enter a comment (e.g. <em>New subproject</em>), and click OK. The 
		files are now checked in to the Code Co-op project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your new Visual Studio.NET project is now fully integrated with your Code Co-op 
	project. You can open the solution in Visual Studio.NET and get to work.</p>
<br />

<h2>Opening a Code Co-op project in Visual Studio.NET</h2>
<p class="first">If you joined a Code Co-op project that was already integrated with Visual Studio.NET you 
	do not have to do anything in order to integrate. You can just open the solution in Visual Studio.NET 
	(an easy way to do this within Code Co-op is to right click on the <em>.sln</em> file and 
	select <b>Open with Shell</b>) and you can start working with it immediately.</p>
<br />
<a name="Renaming"></a>
<h2>Renaming Solutions</h2>
<p class="first"><b>Renaming a solution </b>in Visual Studio.NET can cause problems and is not 
	recommended. If you must rename a solution, here's a sequence that will work. 
	In this example, we're renaming a solution from <em>Original</em> to <em>KillerApp</em>:</p>
<ol style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5pt">
	<li> In Code Co-op, check out <em>Original.sln</em> and <em>Original.vssscc</em></li>
	<li> Start Visual Studio.NET and open the solution.</li>
	<li> Right click on the solution item (at the top of the Solution Explorer window), 
		select <b>Rename</b> and enter the new name.</li>
	<li> If a warning dialog appears, click <b>Continue with Change</b></li>
	<li> Close the solution</li>
	<li> In Code Co-op, go to the <strong>Check-in Area tab</strong> and <b>Un-CheckOut </b><em>Original.sln </em> and <em>Original.vsscc </em> (the files you checked out in step #1)</li>
	<li> Go to the<strong> Files tab</strong> and <b>Delete </b><em>Original.sln</em> and <em>Original.vsscc</em></li>
	<li> Select <em>KillerApp.sln </em>and <em>KillerApp.vsscc, </em>click on the <b>Selection </b> menu and select <b>Add To Project</b></li>
	<li> Go to the <strong>Check-in Area tab</strong>, select <em>KillerApp.sln </em>and <em>KillerApp.vsscc </em> and check them in.</li>
</ol>
You have now successfully renamed your Visual Studio.NET solution. <br />

<a name="sub"></a>
<h2>Upgrading from Visual Studio 6.0 to Visual Studio.NET with 
	sub-projects</h2>
<br />
<p class="first">Upgrading from Visual Studio 6.0 to Visual Studio.NET may produce binding 
	errors if you have sub-projects in VS 6.0. Before outlining the solution, keep 
	in mind that VS.NET organizes development into two layers:</p>
<ul>
	<li> Top-level solution described by a file with the extension .sln in the root 
		directory of the solution tree</li>
	<li> One or more (sub-)projects that could be in the subtrees of the solution tree. 
		If these are C/C++ projects, they are described by files with the extension 
		.vcproj. Their format is XML, which can be edited (with care!).</li>
</ul>
To fix the integration with VS.Net, do the following:
<ul>
	<li> Open the dialog File&gt;Source Control&gt;Change Source Control. You can add 
		one more column, Relative Path, to this display</li>
	<li> You should see there the paths to your subprojects relative to the code co-op 
		root</li>
	<li> If not, go to the corresponding directory, check out the .vcproj file and 
		correct the line that looks like this: SccLocalPath=&quot;..&quot;</li>
	<li> Put &quot; <strong>..</strong> &quot; there if the project directory is one level below the 
		co-op project root, etc</li>
</ul>
<br />

<h2><a name="WebSolutions" id="WebSolutions"></a></h2>
<h2>Visual Studio.NET Web Solutions and Code Co-op Control</h2>
<br />
<p class="first">VS.NET treats <strong>Visual Basic</strong> , <strong>Visual C#</strong> and <strong>Visual J#</strong> <em>Web Solutions</em> in a special way. Adding them to 
	source control requires an additional change in VS.NET configuration.
	Also the process of joining a Web Solution differs from a standard procedure and
	has its own specific requirements. <br />
	Note: You do not have to do any of these for <strong>Visual C++</strong> Web Solutions. </p>
<p><b>Before you create a Web Solution</b> you must set the VS.NET default project directory
	to point to your system's default web publishing folder (usually <strong>&quot;c:\inetpub\wwwroot&quot;</strong>).
	To do this, open the Options dialog from the VS.NET Tools 
	menu and change the default directory in the Environment.Projects and 
	Solutions section. </p>
<p><b>Joining an existing Web Solution on the same computer</b> more than once is
	essentially impossible. </p>
<p>When <b>joining an existing Web Solution from other computers</b> you must be aware of
	the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>all users have to use <em>localhost</em> for the server name</li>
	<li>a project location under the <em>localhost</em> have to 
		be the same for these users (e.g. http://localhost/webproject1)</li>
	<li>an absolute path to the project must be the same
		on all computers (e.g. c:\inetpub\wwwroot\webproject1)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>After you joined an existing Web Solution</b> you will be initially 
	unable to open the solution in VS. <br />
	You will need to ask the sender of the Full Sync to
	send you a copy the <b>&quot;.suo&quot;</b> file. <b>Do not add this file under Co-op's control!</b> The .suo file is a VS file and is placed
	in the root folder of the solution. The sender might not see the .suo file 
	in the explorer if s/he does not have &quot;show hidden files&quot; option set 
	(it has the Hidden attribute). But the sender can always see the .suo
	in Code Co-op's display and drag and drop it to an e-mail message. </p>
<p>By the way, make sure you add <b>&quot;.webinfo&quot;</b> files under Co-op's control.
	VS does not add them by default when Adding Solution to Source Control. </p>
