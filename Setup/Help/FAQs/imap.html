<h1>Why doesn't the dispatcher see the IMAP folder in Outlook?</h1> 

<br />
<p class="first">If you are using an IMAP server, the &quot;Get Mail&quot; function from the dispatcher will not work because your email resides on the server and not your machine. In order for the dispatcher to automatically retrieve scripts, you will need to move your email to the Inbox on your desktop. You can do this by creating a rule which automatically moves email messages with &quot;znc&quot; in the subject to your personal Inbox. </p>
