<h1>How do I manually send a full-sync script?</h1>
<br />
<p class="first">You can send a full-sync script manually by following this procedure: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Remote user joins the project, a join request is sent to you </li>
	<li>You receive the request--it appears in your Code Co-op's<strong> Inbox tab</strong></li>
	<li>Before executing that join script, turn off the dispatcher. (Right click on its icon in the taskbar and select Exit)</li>
	<li>Unpack the join request</li>
	<li>The full sync script will be deposited in c:\co-op\PublicInbox.</li>
	<li>Take it from there, copy on a CD, and send it to the the person joining </li>
	<li>The joiner has to copy this file into the awaiting project's inbox</li>
</ol>

<p class="first">How does the person joining find the project's inbox? When joining the project, an empty enlistment was created on the joinee's machine. It is in the state &quot;Awaiting full sync&quot;. The project appears in the Projects tab, together with its &quot;Project Id&quot; (a number). The inbox for this project is in the folder c:\co-op\Inbox\(project id) assuming you used the default path when installing Code Co-op. </p>
