<h1>Why are scripts being branched? </h1>

<br /> 
<p class="first">To understand why scripts get branched, it is important to understand that each sync script represents one iteration of the project. Each iteration is stored in history and each member's history is identical.  Also, there is a &quot;pecking order&quot; among members. They are ordered by their user id. The top dog is the one with the lowest id (often 0).</p>
		<p><b>A script is branched when</b> two scripts miss each other, more specifically when more than one person performs a check-in against the same project state. (It's always a good idea to check your e-mail before doing a check-in. This doesn't always work, because there are sometimes large delays in e-mail.)</p>
