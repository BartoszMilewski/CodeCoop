	<h1>Why wasn't a script sent out using my email client?</h1>
		<br />
 
		<p class="first">
			Chances are you have multiple email client programs on your computer. 
			Dispatcher always communicates with the default email client and passes it 
			all outgoing messages. If Code Co-op Scripts are not sent out using your favourite email program 
			that means they were passed to another email program.
			You need to make sure that the email client that you want to use with Code Co-op is set as the 
			default.
