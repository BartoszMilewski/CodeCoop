<h1>How do I replace an existing HUB with a new HUB?</h1>
<br />
<p class="first">There are two ways to move project over to a new computer: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To selectively move projects</strong>: 
        Install Code Co-op on the new computer and join the project that you want to move to the new computer. Once you execute full sync on the new computer,&nbsp;go to the old computer and perform History&gt;Export.&nbsp;Copy the&nbsp;history file to the new computer and execute History&gt;Import. Now the project enlistment on the new computer has the same history as the project enlistment on the old computer. </li>
        
<li><strong>To move all projects</strong>    : Install Code Co-op on the new computer. Copy all projects root folders from the old machine to the new machine preserving their location in the file system -- &#145c:\MyProjects\ProjectOne&#146 on the old machine becomes &#145c:\MyProjects\ProjectOne&#146 on the new machine. After copying project source files you have to copy project databases to the new machine. To do this you have to copy &#145co-op&#146 folder from the old machine to the &#145co-op&#146 folder on the new machine. Check that you can visit every project on the new machine. You don't have to import the project's history from the old machine, because by copying project database you already preserved project's history. Delete &#145co-op&#146 folder on the old machine.</li>
<p>After your new hub is set up, all satellites need to point to the new hub. This is done in Collaboration Settings sheet on each satellite by editing Hub's Public Inbox share. The change of the hub path will cause satellites to register all their local enlistments on the new hub.</p>
</ul>
