<h1>Why do I have so many Tentative scripts in my History?</h1>

 	<br />
 
 	<p class="first"> 
 		As the administrator of the project do the following: </p>
 	<ul>
	<li>View the <strong>History tab</strong> </li>
  
	<li>Find the oldest script that is sent by you (the admin) and is still tentative </li>
  
	<li>Double-click on that script and look at the &quot;Awaiting acknowledgments from&quot; box. It will show one or more users who are not responding. They have probably left the project long time ago. Write down  their user IDs </li>
  
	<li> Open <em>Project&gt;Members</em> dialog box, find the users with the IDs from the preceding step </li>
  
	<li>If you know that they are no longer members of the project, remove them from project. If you're not sure, change them to observers.</li>                       
 
</ul>
 
<p class="first">After one more check-in and the acceptance of the script, the history should clear up. If not, repeat the above procedure again.
