<h1>How do I archive inactive projects including history?</h1> 
<br /> 
<ul>
	<li>Select one computer as your archive.</li>
	<li>Join all projects from that computer (it's enough to join as observer--no license needed)</li>
	<li>Ask the member with the longest history in a given project to export his or her history</li>
	<li>Import this history on your archive computer</li>
	<li> Have everybody else defect from the unused projects (before the last person defects, make sure the archived version is selected as administrator).  </li>
</ul>
<p class="first">Any time you want to revive an abandoned project, simply let people join it again. 
	
	This is also a great way to back up your projects. </p>
