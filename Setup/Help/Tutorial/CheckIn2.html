<h1>Reviewing File Changes</h1>
<p>Before you check in your changes, it's a good idea to review them first. A lot of bugs are prevented that way. Double-click on any edited file in the <strong>Check-In Area</strong>, and Code Co-op will open a <em>Differ</em>, in a two-pane window. (Here you can see the built-in differ, but you can switch to the <a href="../Help/beyondcompare.html" target="_blank">Beyond Compare differ</a>, which comes bundled with Code Co-op, using the <i>Tools>Differ</i> menu item.)</p>
<p> The left pane has two tabs:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Current</em> tab shows the current file with your changes applied. Additional changes can be made in the Current tab, which serves as an editor. (Click <em>Refresh</em> in the toolbar to update the right pane after such edits.) </li>
	<li> <em>Before</em> tab shows the file as it was when you checked it out--before your changes. </li>
</ul>
<p> The right pane shows all the changed lines. </p>
