<h1>Creating a New Project: File Extensions</h1>

<p>After you've prepared the list of project files, Code Co-op will start adding them to the project database. For each new extension, it will display the following dialog:</p>

</p>
<p>There are four basic categories of files: header, source, other text, and binary. The most important is the distinction between <b>binary</b> files and other types. Once you assign <b>binary type</b> to a file, you won't be able to see its file differences (which are hard to display for non-text files). The rule of thumb is that files that are not divided into reasonably short lines of text (by newline characters) should be added as <b>binary</b>. In particular images, animations, MP3s, Microsoft Office documents, Access databases, etc., should be treated as binary files. On the other hand, Visual Studio solution and project files (.sln, .vcproj) should be added as (other) text files.</p>
