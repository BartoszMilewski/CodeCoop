<h1>Configuring Your System</h1>
<p>Before you can start using Code Co-op, you have to configure it for collaboration. You have to tell it whether you are the <i>first person</i> to use it, or if you're <i>joining a team</i> of developers who are already using Code Co-op. You also have to specify how you want your computer to communicate with others (e-mail or LAN).</p>

<p class="note">When you are ready to <b>configure Code Co-op</b> follow <a href="WizardStart.html">this link</a>. But first read on...

</p>

<h3>E-mail Configuration</h3>
<p>The simplest and most common configuration is <b>E-mail Peer</b>. As an e-mail peer, your Code Co-op will communicate with other Code Co-op project members using e-mail. You'd be surprised how fast e-mail communication could be. The advantage of e-mail over direct Internet connection (peer-to-peer) is that e-mail servers can store messages. So even if two computers are never on-line at the same time, they can still exchange messages.</p>
<p>Code Co-op dispatcher may use Outlook or Outlook Express as its e-mail client (using MAPI protocol). A better solution is to use the Dispatcher's built-in e-mail client, which communicates with the e-mail server directly (using SMTP/POP3 protocol). If you don't have a dedicated e-mail account for Code Co-op, you can use a free Gmail account instead.</p>

<h3>LAN Configuration</h3>
<p>Collaboration over a Local Area Network is available only in the version Pro of Code Co-op. On a LAN, you have to designate one computer as a <b>Hub</b>. This doesn't have to be a server, it can be any machine that is on most of the time. All other Code Co-op machines on the LAN must be configured as <b>Satellites</b>.

<p>All Code Co-op exchanges within the Local Area Network pass through the Hub. You can also configure the Hub to use e-mail to communicate with the external world. The external world could be e-mail peers, or other remote Hubs. For instance, portable laptops are usually configured as e-mail peers, so they can connect to a project from anywhere.</p>

<h3>Disconnected Operation</h3>

<p>Once you join collaboration on a Code Co-op project, your computer will contain a full replica of the project database: all of its files including their history. You can check files out and modify them even if you are not connected to the Internet. You only need the connection when you are ready to check your changes in.</p>

<h1>Working with Code Co-op</h1>
<p>Code Co-op is a full-function version constrol system. It lets you modify project files, keeps track of all versions, and makes your changes visible to other collaborators.</p>
<p>Code Co-op tries to keep the impression of a <b>single development line</b>, with interleaved  contributions from all collaborators. It keeps branching and merging to the very minimum (although it offers full support for these operations).</p>

<h3>Starting a Project</h3>
<p>Each Code Co-op project appears as a directory (or a tree of directories) on your disk. If you already have files that form a development project, you can start a Code Co-op project in place. Or you can start an empty project and add files (and subdirectories) later.</p>

<h3>Joining a Collaboration</h3>
<p>You can join an existing Code Co-op project, either by asking the project <i>administrator</i> to send you an <i>Invitation</i>, or by sending a <i>Join Request</i> to any project member.</p>

<h3>Working with Project Files</h3>
<p>The minimal development cycle in Code Co-op consists of three stages:
<ul>
	<li>Checking files <b>out</b> as the need arises (often directly from the development environment)</li>
	<li>Modifying files using external tools</li>
	<li>Checking <b>in</b> changes (sets of modified files) using Code Co-op.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>You may accept changes from other project members at any time--they arrive as soon as other members make their check-ins. If the changes modify some of the files you are currently editing, the built-in merger performs the merges. You have to accept all pending changes before making your check-in.</p>
