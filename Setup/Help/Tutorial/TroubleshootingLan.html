<h2>Troubleshooting Network Connections </h2>
<p>The first time computers on the LAN talk to each other, you might get a 
	logon failure alert:
<p class="image">
<img src="../Images/NetworkAlert.gif" />
</p>

<p>That means that your computer doesn't know how to log on to the other computer 
	in order to access its share.	</p>
<p>To remedy this, open your Network Neighborhood (Or Computer > Network on Vista), find the share listed in the 
	alert, and open it. You'll be prompted for a password. Enter the password and 
	select the checkbox &quot;remember password&quot;.		</p>
