<h1>Checking Files In</h1>
<p>The check-in operation creates a permanent snapshot of your project. Usually you do the check-in after completing a well-defined task. The task might have consisted of several file edits; possibly combined with file deletions, additions, renames, or moves. Code Co-op lets you check all these changes in one <em>atomic operation</em>. Selective, or even single-file check-ins are also possible, but in most cases you will be pressing the <em>Check In All Files</em> button in the <strong>Check-In Area</strong>. You can also specify the level of testing done on your changes, if applicable, by clicking the appropriate radio button. </p>
<p>It's good practice to associate a description with such a snapshot, that's why Code Co-op will ask you for a comment. This comment will appear in your (and others') Project History. </p>

<p>Every check-in generates a script of changes that is sent to other members of the project. This script will apply your changes to their copies of the project. It will also carry your check-in comments to others.</p>
