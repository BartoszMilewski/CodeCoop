<h1>Checking Files Out</h1>
<p>Files that are under Code Co-op's control are write protected. You cannot modify them without checking them out. (Many development environments integrate with Code Co-op and let you check out files either directly or in response to editing.) </p>
<p>In Code Co-op, you <b>check out</b> a file by <em>selecting</em> it in the <strong>Files tab</strong> and pressing the <em>Check-Out button</em> or by right-clicking  on the file to invoke the context menu as shown here.</p>

</p>

<p>You should also use Code Co-op's UI to perform such file operations as rename (in-place edit), delete, and move (cut and paste).</p>
