	<strong><em><span style="color: dodgerblue">Code Co-op Lite</span></em></strong>
</p>

<p>In the "Invite New Project Member" dialog, you must provide the name of the invitee and their e-mail address. There is also a checkbox for inviting a member as an Observer (an Observer has a read-only view of the project and doesn't require a license). </p>

</p>

<p>When you click OK, Code Co-op will pack all the project files into one invitation script and e-mail it to the recipient. For large projects, this process may take a few minutes and the script may be split into multiple chunks, each sent in a separate message.</p>
