<h1>Configuring LAN and E-mail Collaboration</h1>
	<em><span style="color: dodgerblue">(This feature is not available in Code Co-op Lite)<br />
	</span></em>

<p>You may use both LAN and E-mail for collaboration. E-mail is used between your hub and other hubs or e-mail peers. LAN is used between your hub and its satellite machines. Satellites don't use e-mail directly, they forward synchronization scripts to their hub, which then e-mails them to the outside world.</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>If you are joining an existing LAN collaboration, configure your machine as a <a href="SatelliteConfig.html">Satellite</a> (there already is a hub).</li>
<li>If you are starting a fresh LAN with e-mail setup, you have to first configure <a href="lanmix.html">the Hub</a>.</li>
</ul>
</p>
