<h1>Accepting Sync Scripts</h1>

<p>Every time your teammates perform a check-in, you receive a script with their changes (it's the so called "push" model). The script arrives through e-mail or your network and ends up in the <strong>Inbox</strong> tab of the project. Script changes are not reflected in your project files until you <b>execute</b> <img src="../Images/execute.gif" alt="execute script button" hspace="2" /> the scripts in the Inbox.</p>

</p>
<p>Before you execute a script, you can review the changes it will make to your files. Select the script in the Inbox. In the details pane below, double-click on a file, and a visual differ opens, showing the script's changes. (You can either use the built-in Differ or the <strong>Beyond Compare</strong> differ as your file comparator (use the <em>Tools>Differ</em> menu item to switch between them.) </p>

<h3>Remember...</h3>
<p>If a script modifies a file that you have checked out and worked on, Code Co-op will attempt to <b>merge</b> changes. You will be notified when this is the case. <b>Always review the results of a merge</b> which will be listed in the <a href="../Help/syncMergeTab.html">Synch Merge</a> tab.
