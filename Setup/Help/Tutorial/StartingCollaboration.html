<h1>Starting Collaboration  </h1>
<p>Using Code Co-op you collaborate on individual projects. Each <i>Code Co-op Project</i> is a set of files and directories sharing a common <i>Project Root</i> directory. You can either <b>enlist</b> in an existing project or create a new one.</p>

<h2>Getting Invited</h2>
<p>If you are joining an existing collaboration, you will probably want to enlist in an existing project. The easiest way to do it is to ask the <i>Administrator</i> of a given project to send you an <b>invitation</b>. The administrator must know your name and your e-mail address. If your machine is a network satellite, you have to provide the administrator with the e-mail address of your hub and the  name of your computer.</p>

<h2>Joining</h2>
<p>If you know the name of the project and the e-mail address of any member of the project, you may elect to <b>join</b> the project instead. The difference is that you are the one proposing collaboration and sending a <i>Join Request</i>.</p>

<h2>Creating New Project</h2>
<p>You may also start a new collaboration by creating a <b>new project</b>. You can create a new empty project and then add files to it, or you can select an existing tree of files and turn it into a Code Co-op project. You will automatically become the Administrator of the project and you can start inviting others or accept their Join Requests.</p>

<h2>Defecting from Project</h2>
<p>When you no longer want to participate in a project, you should <b>defect</b> from it. When you defect all other project members are notified about it and they will no longer send scripts to you.</p>
