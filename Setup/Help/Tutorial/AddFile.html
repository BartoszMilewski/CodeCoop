<h1>Adding and Creating Files</h1>
<p>When  you create files outside of Code Co-op, save these files within the project directory tree. They will appear in the<strong> Files tab</strong> as not-in-project (blank icon).</p>

<h2>Adding existing files to your project</h2>
<p>Select the files and click the &quot;Add Selected Files&quot; button <img src="../Images/addTool.gif" hspace="2" align="absmiddle" /> from the toolbar. Later, once you check-in these files, they will officially become part of the project and other members will be able to see them.</p>

</p> 

<h2>Creating new files in Code Co-op</h2>
<p> We recommend creating new source and text files from inside Code Co-op. The advantage is that the file will automatically be added to the project (panding a check-in), and that Code Co-op may initialize them with a copyritht string of your choice, or with an include guard for C/C++ header files. Select the Create File button<img src="../Images/createTool.gif" hspace="2" />. You will be prompted for file name and type.</p>
