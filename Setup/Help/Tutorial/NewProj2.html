<h1>Creating a New Project: Selecting Files</h1>

<p>Code Co-op will help you selectively add existing files to the projects. Since there may be a lot of files in the tree, Code Co-op lets you pick project files by extension first, and by name second. This is the file selection dialog:</p>

</p>

<p>Clicking on an extension adds it or removes it from the list. Once an extension is selected, files with that extension are shown in the right pane. You can then selectively add or remove them from the list. The example above is typical for a Visual C++ project.</p>
