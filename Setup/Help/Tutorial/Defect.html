<h1>Defecting from Project</h1>
<p>To defect from a project (stop being part of the collaboration), select <i>Defect (Delete)</i> from the <i>Project</i> menu. When you defect from a project, you may delete or keep project files. The default is &quot;<em>Defect but preserve project tree</em>&quot;. Even if you choose to delete the files during <em>Defect</em>, they will end up in your recycle bin. </p>
