<p>Removing and then creating a folder of the same name with different uppercasing ignored the change of case.</p>
<p>Membership history repair failed on some corrupt histories.</p>

<h2>New features:</h2>
<p>Allow multi-script selection in merge view. This makes possible selective merges of multiple scripts at once.</p>
<p>Project Repair repairs membership history of defected members.</p>
<p>Allow uninstall without defecting (very useful when moving co-op installation to a different machine).</p>
<p>Implemented new SCC interface v. 1.3. It's possible now to delete checked-out files from Visual Studio.</p>

<h1>Code Co-op 5.0a, December 6, 2006</h1>

<br/>

<h1>Code Co-op 5.0, November 15, 2006</h1>
<br/>
		 <h2>Peer-To-Peer Wiki </h2>
		 <p>A Wiki site as a feature of a version control system? Only we could come up with such a crazy idea! What were we thinking? </p>
		 <p>Well, it started with text files. Code Co-op users quickly find out that they   have a great tool for sharing notes. You jot a few lines, check the file in, and   it's immediately available on your laptop, where you have a second enlistment.   Or you add a text file with feature requests right in your development project.   Soon enough you start using Code Co-op for documentation, or even to store bug   reports. </p>
		 <p>We've been doing these things for some time, but we were always dissatisfied   with the lack of formatting and structure afforded by text files. We needed   something that's almost as easy to edit as text, but with the power and   flexibility of an HTML document. Wiki was the obvious choice. </p>
		 <p>Here's what we did: We created a wiki parser and built a web browser control   directly to Code Co-op. When Code Co-op enters a directory with a file called   index.wiki, the parser parses it, converts into HTML, and the browser control   displays it as a web page. The wiki file can be as simple as a plain text file.   But with a little bit of easy-to-learn wiki markup, you can add simple   formatting, embed links to other wiki pages, or display pictures. </p>
		 <p>But that's not all. Since the browser control is a full-blown internet   browser, you can follow links from your local wiki pages to any external web   site. You can also mix HTML or even JavaScript into your wiki pages. </p>
<br/>
		 <h2>Bug Database </h2>
		 <p>Had we stopped at that, we would just have a great peer-to-peer wiki   system--which we do! It can be used to create and share wiki sites without the   need for servers. But we needed a &quot;killer app&quot; for our wiki. We wanted a   wiki-based bug database. </p>
		 <p>What's the biggest shortcoming of bug databases? That they impose rigid   structure on all bug reports. We wanted to be able to embed a screenshot or two   in a report, a piece of preformatted code, a table, and so on. In other words,   we wanted each bug report to be a wiki file. But we also wanted to be able to   have a few &quot;tuples&quot; in each record--a &quot;priority&quot; field, an &quot;assigned to&quot; field,   and so on. And, we had to be able to list the records based on the values of   these fields. For instance, to list all open bugs assigned to Bartosz. </p>
		 <p>It sounds hard to believe, but we were actually able to accomplish it. We had   to invent a mini-SQL language, which we call SQWiki, and do a few tricks, but   the result is pretty specatacular considering the simplicity of the design. </p>
		 <p>As a side effect, Code Co-op now has a very flexible text-based database   built into it. You can use it to store and retrieve any kinds of notes. And   because it's so simple, you can do it without any training in database   management. </p>
<br/>
		 <h2>Ease of Use </h2>
		 <p>What's the use of all the features if they are hard to find and hard to use?   That's why we put so much effort in Code Co-op's user interface. Version 5.0   breaks new grounds in this respect. </p>
		 <p>The most spectacular feature is a split-pane history display. You select a   script in the history pane and the lower pane immediately shows the list of   files modified by that script. Double-click on a file in the lower pane and a   differ opens, showing exactly how that file was changed by the selected script.   The same mechanism works for scripts that are still in the inbox. </p>
		 <p>We made it very easy to view, save, compare and merge historical versions of   files. </p>
		 <p>This ease of reviewing changes prompted us to simplify the synchronization   process. You can preview an incoming script in the inbox and then execute it   with a single click. Or you can skip previewing, only to later review the script   in the history. </p>
		 <p>If the incoming script interferes with your local changes, the conflicting   files are visible in the Local Merge area (used to be Synch Area). You can   preview and correct the automatic merge, or you can use an external tool   to perform the merge. </p>
<br/>
		 <h2>Project Manipulation </h2>
		 <p>We listen to our users. We not always have the resources to address all the   wishes, but we try. </p>
		 <p>A surprising number of our clients use Code Co-op to manage large numbers of   projects. To make their lives easier, we added a special pane listing the most   &quot;interesting&quot; projects. This pane is displayed in the main file area and in the   proect area. It shows the projects that require user action, e.g., have pending   scripts or checked-out files; as well as a few recently visited projects. </p>
		 <p>We created a command-line tool that can perform certain commands for all   projects. Some users needed to be able to synchronize all projects in one pass.   Others wanted to change their status to Observer before going on vacation (and   then back to Voting Member) in all projects. </p>
		 <p>Joining a project has always been a bit of a problem. You had to have the   project name just right, and the correct e-mail address of an existing member.   Why not &quot;invite&quot; a new member instead of making him or her join? We finally   implemented invitations. And not only that--we made it possible to invite a new   member to ALL your projects using a command-line tool. </p>
<br/>
		 <h2>Dispatcher </h2>
		 <p>We've been under tremendous pressure from our users to improve the   dispatching of scripts. In version 5.0 we made two major breakthroughs. We made   the dispatcher non-blocking, and we added the SMTP/POP3 support. </p>
		 <p>There are times when the dispatcher has no idea how to dispatch a script.   This happens because of configuration problems or user mistakes. In such cases,   the dispatcher used to pop up a dialog box and wait. When that happened on an   unattended hub, all traffic was stopped. Not any more! </p>
		 <p>Instead of a dialog, a baloon alert is displayed. If there's nobody to click   on the baloon, the problem script goes into quarantine, and waits until somebody   can deal with it. </p>
		 <p>The addition of SMTP/POP3 support to the dispatcher makes the use of e-mail   for synchronization a breeze. In fact, if you can afford separate e-mail   accounts, you should configure all your computers as e-mail peers and rely   entirely on SMTP/POP3. This is one of these things that &quot;just work&quot;. It's better   than MAPI and sometimes even better than LAN. </p>
<br/>
		 <h2>Branching </h2>
		 <p>The problem with branches is that they have to be merged. Even with the best   of tools it's a tedious, error-prone, and menial task. Code Co-op was designed   to avoid branching (except for the heavy-duty branching after a realease--when   the project has to split into maintenance- and continuing-development version). </p>
		 <p>Neverthless, some merging is unavoidable, and we decided to make it as   painless as possible. In version 5.0 a built-in merge tool (Beyond Compare Merger) can be used to   perform merges. We also rationalized conflict resolution. </p>
		 <p>Occasionally two or more scripts miss each other. When that happens, Code   Co-op creates a branch point. One of the branches becomes a trunk, the other has   to be merged into the trunk. </p>
		 <p>In version 5.0, the person who is actively working on a losing branch may be   able to postpone the execution of the incoming winning script and continue   making side-branch check-ins. At some point, of course, a merge should be   performed. </p>
		 <p>A merge is as easy as selecting the branch script in the history pane,   selecting a file in the lower pane, and clicking the merge button to start an   (external) file merger. </p>
		<p>Merging is also easy when you have a project that was created by branching from some other project. You can open the Branch Merge view (either from History, or from the View menu), and select a branch project. You can then pick a script and individual files that have to be merged. </p>
