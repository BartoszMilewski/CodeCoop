<h1>Wikifying a Folder</h1>
<p class="first">To turn a folder in your project into a <a href="WikiProject.html">wiki site</a> select <i>Wikify</i> from the <i>Folder</i> menu. If the current folder is the root folder of your project, you will wikify the whole project.</p>
<p>This is what happens when you wikify a folder:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A file <i>index.wiki</i> is created. Initially it contains links to the system wiki help, so you can access help immediately.</li>
	<li>The view is switched to the browser tab and the index file is displayed in the form of a web page.</li>
	<li>The text editor is opened on the index file, so that you can start editing it immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Probably the first thing you'd want to edit is the title of the page. This page will become the <i>home page</i> of your wiki site. You extend your wiki site by creating <i>wiki links</i> in your home page. Each wiki link can lead to another wiki page--the page will actually be created the first time you click on such a link. All this is explained in detail in wiki help pages.</p>
<p>Note: The only thing that distinguishes a wiki folder from any other project folder is the presence of the file <i>index.wiki</i>. So if you want to de-wikify a folder, simply delete this file. Conversely, any time you create a file with this special name, the folder the file is in will be wikified (even if the file is not part of the Code Co-op project).</p>
<p>A wikified folder may contain subfolders. One such special subfolder is called <i>Image</i> and it contains image files that are displayed on wiki pages. This folder is automatically created the first time you embed an image in a wiki page. Other subfolders are treated as database tables--the wiki files in them become database records. See wiki help for details (to do that, wikify a folder and follow the links to help).</p>
