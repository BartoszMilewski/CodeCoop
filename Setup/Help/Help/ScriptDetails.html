<h1>Script Properties Dialog</h1>
<p class="first"> The <b>General</b> tab shows who created the script and when it was created. It shows who did not acknowledge the script, or from whom  the final acknowledgement is still due. Also listed are the script dependencies&mdash;these are the scripts that have to be present in the history before the given script can be executed.</p>
<p>The <b>Files</b> tab shows what files have been changed by this script. Double-clicking on a file in the list shows a list of differences. Note: To <a href="ReviewScript.html">view the changes</a> described in the script in the context of the whole file, select the script in the Inbox and double click on a file in the Details pane.</p>
