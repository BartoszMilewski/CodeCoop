<h1>Accept Sync in the Sync Merge Tab </h1>
<p>In situations where a merge is required, the files will be listed in the <a href="syncmergetab.html">Synch Merge</a> tab. You may view and edit the files that are undergoing a merge or check out files and <a href="manualreject.html">manually reject</a> some of the changes brought in by the sync. When you are done reviewing the files click on the <em>Accept Sync</em> button.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: You cannot simply refuse to accept a sync, because the same script has already been sent to other members of the project. All you can do is to make your counter-changes and check them in after accepting the sync. Youc can also restore the project to its previous version and then do the check-in.</p>
