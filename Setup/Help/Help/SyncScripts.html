<h1>Executing a Script</h1>
<p class="first">The <a  href="InboxTab.html">Inbox</a> area lists all the incoming scripts. The Inbox is intelligent enough to recognize which script should be executed next. This next script in line is marked using this <em><img src="../Images/nextscript.gif" alt="next script" width="17" height="16" hspace="2" /></em> icon. Selecting any script will list the affected files in the details pane below. Sometimes you'll see a script marked &quot;missing&quot;. If you have a <b>missing</b> script, Code Co-op will automatically send <a href="ResendScript.html">re-send requests</a> to other project members. </p>
<br />
<p class="first">Execute scripts by doing one of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Click the <em>Execute next script</em> button<img src="../Images/execute.gif" alt="Execute Next Script" width="21" height="18" hspace="5" /> (it is only active when there is something to execute)</li>
	<li>Select <em>Sync Next Script</em> entry in the <em>Selection</em> menu</li>
	<li>Use the keyboard shortcut to execute all incoming scripts: <b>Ctrl-S</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="first">By executing a script you are applying changes from the script to the files in your project. Sometimes Code Co-op detects a  conflict between script changes and your local edits--you will be notified whether you need to attend to a <a href="Merge.html">merge</a>. Sometimes there is a conflict betwee scripts that miss each other. In that case you will be notified that a <a href="LocalBranch.html">branch</a> was created and you should merge it back.</p>
