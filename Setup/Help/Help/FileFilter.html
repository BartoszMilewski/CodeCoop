<h1>Filtering in File View</h1>
<p>
You can hide certain types of files in file view by clicking on the <em>Apply File Filter</em> button in the toolbar. The default filter is set to hide non-project files. You can edit the filter using the <em>Change File Filter...</em> item from the <em>View</em> menu.
</p>

<p>
You can also directly add or remove files with certain extensions from the filter. Select the file in question and select either <em>Add Extension to File Filter</em> or <em>Remove Extension from File Filter</em> from the <em>Selection</em> menu. Of course, you can remove an extension from the filter only when the file is visible--that is, the filtering is turned off.
</p>

<p>
The filter lets you hide files with certain extensions. Notice that the &quot;hide non-project files&quot; checkbox is active (and can be unchecked) only when you have some extensions in your filter.
</p>

<p>The filter is global--it applies to all projects.</p>
<p>Hint: If you notice that some files are not displayed in Files view, it's probably because a filter is on.</p>
