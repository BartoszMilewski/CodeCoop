<h1>Bulk Addition of Files</h1>
<p>Files can be added to project during its creation or at any later time. You can add files <a href="AddFile.html">individually</a> or in bulk. When you select <em>Add More Files</em> from the <em>Project</em> menu, Code Co-op will rescan the whole project and list all non-project files organized by file extensions. You can select whole groups or individual files and add them to project. Of course, you'll have to check in the newly added files in order for other project members to see them.</p>
<p>The same operation, <em>Add More Files</em>, only on a smaller scale is available from the <em>Folder</em> menu. Code Co-op will scan only the selected folder and its sub-folders.</p>
