<h1>Integration with SCC</h1>
<p class="first">Code Co-op integrates with any application that uses the <b>Microsoft SCC API</b>. In particular it integrates with Microsoft Developer Studio (C++, Java, VB), CodeWright, VisualAge, Cold Fusion, HomeSite and many others. You'll be able to check files out, check them in, un-checkout, diff, etc., directly from the application (our SccDll.dll calls Code Co-op behind the scenes to perform these operations).</p>
