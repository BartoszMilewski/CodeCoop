<h1>Check-in Area Tab</h1>
<p>
This is where all the checked-out, deleted and new files go before being checked-in. You can sort the files by any of the fields: Name, Change, State, Type, Date, Path, or ID.

</p>

<p>
Double-clicking on a file in this area will open the <a href="differ.html">differ</a> to 
display the differences between the current state of the file and the state from before the check-out. It will&nbsp;show you the changes you've made so far to the file. If the file has not changed since being checked out, the Code Co-op editor will launch instead of the differ.

<ul>
	<li><img src="../Images/checkinAll.gif" alt="Check-in all" width="22" height="21" hspace="3" />The first button, &quot;check-in all&quot;, is the most used one. </li>
	<li><img src="../Images/checkinSelect.gif" alt="check-in selected" width="19" height="22" hspace="3" />The second button is used when you want to do a partial check-in. You can select specific files by holding the Ctrl key and clicking on specific files. </li>
	<li><img src="../Images/uncheck.gif" alt="uncheckout button" width="20" height="19" hspace="3" />The third button let's you Un-CheckOut a file which undos all the edits you've made since the check-out. </li>
	<li><img src="../Images/checkinOpen.gif" alt="Open File" width="22" height="19" hspace="3" />The next button will open selected files in your differ. </li>
	<li><img src="../Images/checkinRefresh.gif" alt="Refresh Button" width="18" height="20" hspace="3" />The last button, &quot;refresh&quot;, updates the &quot;changed&quot; column which marks the files that have been changed since the checkout. By the way, by clicking on the header of the &quot;changed&quot; column you can sort files by the &quot;changed&quot; attribute.</li>
