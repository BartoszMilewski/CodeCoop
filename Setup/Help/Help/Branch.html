<h1>Branching your project </h1>

<p>
You can create a new project by branching from any version of an existing project in your <a href="historyTab.html">History</a> tab.
</p>

<h2>Branch Starting with the Current Version</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Select <em>Branch</em> from the <em>Project</em> menu</li>
	<li>The Branch dialog is almost identical to the <em><a href="createProject.html">New Project</a></em> dialog</li>
	<li>Name the branch project and provide the location for it </li>
	<li><a href="invitation.html">Invite</a> the members of the old project to the new project, or ask the to <a href="JoinProject.html">join</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>To Branch Starting with a Historical Version:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>In the History view, select the version from which you wish to branch (the branch project will start in the state <em>after</em> the script you've selected)</li>
	<li>Select <em>Branch</em> from the <em>Selection</em> menu</li>
	<li>Continue as above</li>
</ul>
<h2>Branch Project Options</h2>
<p>
When branching a project, you  have the same options as when you create a new project. The <em>Options</em> tab of the <em>Create Project Branch</em> dialog gives you the following  choices:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Automatically execute  <em>all incoming  synchronization</em> scripts</li>
	<li>Automatically accept all Join requests </li>
	<li>Keep files checked out after each check-in </li>
	<li>Create a Distribution Project </li>
</ul>

<p>
The first three options will automate regular processes. The last option, Create a Distribution Project, is for projects being used to distribute source code to clients that require privacy and certain limitations. For more information, go to <a href="Distribution.html">About Distribution Projects</a>.
</p>
 
<h2>Branch Merging</h2>
<p>
A branch project shares some history with the original project. Because of that, it's possible to merge changes between such projects. The merging can be performed in either direction: from the original project to the branch or vice versa. Merges are also possible across several branchings (the branch of my branch is also my branch).
</p>

<p>
Notice that new members of the branch project don't share history with the original project and can't immediately perform merges. For new members to perform merges, they first have to <a href="importHistory.html">import the history</a> from the branch project.
