<h1>Observer Members</h1>
<br />
<h2>What it means to be an observer: </h2>
<p class="first">
<ul>
	<li>An Observer in a project will receive all sync scripts as they are created just like any Voting Member.
	</li>
	<li>An Observer cannot check-out and modify project files and check them in. </p>
	</li>
	<li>An Observer can perform tasks like opening and viewing project files, reviewing the project history, and viewing differences between versions.
	</li>
	<li>Anybody can be an Observer in a project <em>without the need to purchase a license.</em>
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Examples of when an Observer member is useful: </h3>
<p class="first">
<ul>
	<li>Team managers that want to track the  progress of a project </li>
	<li>Computer or server used for back-up purposes </li>
	<li>Computer or server used for publishing or staging project files </li>
</ul> 
</p>
<h2>Caution</h2>
<p class="first">An observer doesn't take part in the script acknowledgment cycle. In practice it means that an observer might be missing scripts without other project members being aware of that (they will see scripts as "confirmed", even if the observer hasn't received them). Therefore, when a member changes their status from "observer" to "voting member", his or her next check-in may cause a lot of history being rejected. That's why such a change is accompanied by sending a <a href="RequestVerification.html">verification request</a> and blocking check-ins until a verification script arrives.</p>
