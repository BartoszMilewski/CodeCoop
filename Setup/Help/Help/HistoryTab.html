	<h1>History Tab</h1>
	<p class="image">

	</p>
	<p>The <strong>History tab</strong> shows  the repository of all check-ins (scripts), whether done by you or other project members, in the order in 
	which they were applied to the project. </p>
	<p>Each script listing shows additional details including who made the change, when it was made, and the state of the script.</p>

	<h3>Script States</h3>
	<p>In order to understand various script states, here's the glossary of terms used in the &quot;State&quot; column of the 
		History display</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Confirmed: All project members accepted this script</li>
		<li> Branch: The script was in conflict with a higher priority script and was 
			branched (see <a href="LocalBranch.html">Branch</a>)</li>
		<li>Tentative: Your own script waiting for acknowledgments from other project members</li>
		<li>Unconfirmed: Somebody else's script waiting for final acknowledgment from its sender</li>
		<li>Overdue: Your own script that has been tentative for more than two weeks</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In many case a script becomes <em>overdue</em> because some project members 
		stopped responding to scripts. You should notify the administrator of the project
		about such &quot;dead souls.&quot; The administrator should either remove those members from
		the project or change their status to <a href="observer.html">Observer</a>.<br />
	</p>
	<h3>Details Pane</h3>
	<p>The Details pane at the bottom shows all the files affected by a particular script. From within this pane you can:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="first">Double-click a file to view the changes in the visual differ</span></li>
		<li>Save selected files either before or after the script to a designated location</li>
		<li>Select a file and add it to the history filter and later remove it</li>
	</ul>
