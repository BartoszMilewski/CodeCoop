<h1>Creating Labels</h1>
<p class="first">Sometimes you just want to append a special label to history, to mark a milestone. Choose <em>Add Label</em> from the <em>History</em> menu (you have to be in the <strong>History tab</strong>). A label will be propagated like any other script, so that other members will see it in their histories.</p>

<p>Note: Most version control system require labels in order to retrieve previous versions of your project. This is not the case with Code Co-op. Every check-in creates a version of your project from which you can branch, restore files, or export. Adding a label creates a visual marker in your project history for easier retrieval.</p>
