<h1>Inbox Tab</h1>
<p>
The<strong> Inbox tab</strong> is where you  see all the incoming sync scripts. Before executing a script to sychronize it with your project, you have the option to review the incoming changes
</p>
<p class="image">
<img src="../images/inbox.gif" alt="Mailbox" width="417" height="400" hspace="5" vspace="10" border="1" />
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The script with this icon <img src="../Images/nextscript.gif" alt="Next Script" width="17" height="16" hspace="2" />is the next script to be executed.  The comment of this next script  is shown in the toolbar and can be expanded by clicking on the down arrow to the right of it. </li>
	<li>The other scripts with this icon <img src="../Images/envelop.gif" alt="Scripts awaiting turn" width="15" height="11" hspace="2" />  are awaiting their turn. </li>
	<li>If  <em>missing</em> scripts are detected, you will see a status &quot;Waiting for resend from...&quot;. You do not need to do anything. These scripts have been automatically requested and will be resent by the other project member.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Details Pane for Reviewing Incoming Scripts </h2>
<p>When you select an incoming script, the details pane  lists the files affected by that  script. </p>
<p>From there you can perform the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Double-click a file to view the changes in the <a href="differ.html">visual differ</a></li>
	<li><a href="editsync.html">Edit-Sync</a>  (context  or Selection Menu) to view the files before and after the script and perform your own changes (possibly undoing some of the script changes). You will be taken to the Sync Merge tab to make your edits. </li>
	<li><a href="InboxSave.html">Save Files</a> to save the file in either the state it was before this sync script or with the incoming changes applied. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Executing a Script</h2>
<p>Executing a script is the process of synchronizing the incoming changes with your local project. To Execute the <strong>&lt;-Next</strong> script,  click <img src="../Images/execute.gif" alt="execute script" width="21" height="18" hspace="2" />.</p>
