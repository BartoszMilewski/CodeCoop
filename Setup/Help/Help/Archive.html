<h1>Archiving History</h1>
<p>When your history gets too long, Code Co-op's History display might slow down considerably. To make Code Co-op more responsive, select a relatively old version in the <a href="historyTab.html">History</a> and choose <em>Archive</em> from the <em>Selection</em> menu. Co-op will stop displaying versions that are older than the one you've selected. You can un-archive your history at any time by selecting <em>UnArchive</em> from the <em>Selection</em> menu. Currently there is no way to physically shorten the history file, only to hide part of it.
