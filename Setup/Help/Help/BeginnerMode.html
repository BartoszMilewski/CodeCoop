<h1>Beginner Mode</h1>
<p>
When you start using Code Co-op, after almost every action you will see a <em>Beginner's tip</em>. It is usually a short description of what you have just done and what you may do next. Each tip has a &quot;Don't show me again&quot; checkbox. Additionally, you may turn off all tips by clicking <em>Beginner mode</em> in the <em>Help</em> menu. (Clicking it again, will turn the tips back on.)
