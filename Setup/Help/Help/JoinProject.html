<h1>Joining an Existing Project</h1>
<p class="first">Once somebody has created a project, you may join it by selecting <em>Join</em> from 
	the <em>Project</em> menu. The immediate result of joining is that Code Co-op generates a 
	special &quot;<em>join request</em>&quot; script that will be sent to an existing member of the 
	project. It will be routed  to the project <b>administrator</b>&mdash;this is usually 
	the person who created the project. Once the administrator executes your &quot;<em>join request</em>&quot;, 
	his Code Co-op will generate a special &quot;<em>full-sync</em>&quot; script and send it back to you. 
	When you <a href="SyncScripts.html">execute</a> that script, your project tree will be 
	populated with the exact copies of the files and folders that the administrator had in his 
project. You'll have a <em>full copy</em> of the whole project on your machine.</p>
<br />
<h2>How to Join a Project</h2>
<p class="first">After you select Project &gt; Join, you will answer some questions in the Join Dialog.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Who invited you</strong>? You need to know whether the person shares your Hub (is on the same LAN as you), or is an e-mail peer or uses a different Hub. If they are an e-mail peer or on a different Hub, you will need to enter their (or their Hub's) e-mail address. Known Hubs/Peers are listed in the pulldown list.</li>
	<li>The <strong>project name</strong>. Do not misspell it or the Dispatcher will give 
	you grief. If you do misspell, you will have to delete the script, defect and re-join again.</li>
	<li>Specify a <strong>project folder</strong> where you want your working files. You may specify any <b>folder</b>--if 
	the folder doesn't exist, Co-op will create it for you.</li>
	<li>Enter your <b>personal data</b>--name, and comment (e.g., a phone number). This 
information will be  available to every member of your project (under the <em>Members</em> item of the <em>Project</em> menu).</li>
</ul>
 
<h2>Project Options</h2>
<p class="first"> During the join process, you also can set some project options. The <em>Options</em> tab of the <em>Join Project</em> dialog gives you the following  choices:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Automatically execute  <em>full sync</em> script</li>
	<li>Automatically execute all subsequent synchronization scripts</li>
	<li>Keep files checked out after each check-in </li>
	<li>Join Project as an <a href="observer.html">Observer</a> (free license) </li>
</ul>
