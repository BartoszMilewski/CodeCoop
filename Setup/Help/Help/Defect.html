<h1>Defecting from a Project</h1>
<p>
Sometimes a person wants to quit a project permanently. He or she should do it in an orderly fashion by &quot;defecting&quot; from project (selecting <em>Defect</em> from the <em>Project</em> menu). A special &quot;defect script&quot; is produced by Code Co-op and sent to all remaining members of the project, so they know not to send any more synchronization scripts to that person.
</p>
 
<p>When defecting, you get the option of preserving or deleting the project tree from your computer. If you choose to delete the tree, it will be moved to your <b>recycle bin</b>.
