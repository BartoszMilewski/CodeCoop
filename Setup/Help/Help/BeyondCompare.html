<h1>Beyond Compare</h1>
<p>
The distributon of Code Co-op includes the Beyond Compare (BC) Differ/Merger, which is a light version of <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com" target="_blank">Scooter Software's</a> Beyond Compare product. This version is limited to comparing and merging text files, as opposed to binary files and whole directories.
</p>
<h2>The Differ </h2>
<p>
For showing file differences, you have a choice of using the BC Differ or a built-in differ. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. The built-in differ, for instance, is useful when besides viewing differences between historical version (either in Inbox or History view), you would also like to edit the <i>current</i> version of a file.
</p>
<h2>The Merger </h2>
<p>
The BC merger distributed with Code Co-op can be used for <a href="ProjectMerge.html">inter-project merges</a> or <a href="LocalMerge.html">local branch merges</a>.
