<h1>Differ Options</h1>

<p>
You can select the program used by Code Co-op to compare files (for instance, in the Check-in Area, or in the History tab): 
One option is to use the built-in Differ; or use Scooter Software's <a href="BeyondCompare.html">Beyond Compare 
 Differ</a>, which is  included in the Code Co-op distribution; or <a href="guiffy.html">Guiffy SureMerge</a>, which you have to purchase separately.
</p>
