<h1>Renaming a File</h1>
<p class="first">Renaming is as easy as in-place editing the file name in the Files Area. That's all! The file is automatically checked-out and you'll see it in the <strong>Check-in Area</strong> (of course, besides renaming it, you can also edit its contents). When you check-in the renamed file, the name change, along with any other changes, will be propagated to other project members. Remember, do not to rename files using other tools, even when the files are checked out--Code Co-op will not be able to guess what you have done outside of it.</p>
