<h1>Exporting Old Project Versions</h1>
<p class="first">Sometimes you want to save a historical version of the whole project. For instance, you might want to build an old version of your product. To do that, select the version in <a href="historyTab.html">History</a> and choose <em>Export Version</em> from the <em>Selection</em> menu. The <b>whole project tree</b>, as it existed right <i>after</i> the script you have selected, will be copied to a new destination.
