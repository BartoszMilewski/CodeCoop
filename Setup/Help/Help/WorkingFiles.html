<h1>Working with Files</h1>
<br />
<h2>Navigating through your project.</h2>
<p class="first">In the <a href="FilesTab.html">Files Area</a> you can navigate through your project by double-clicking on folders in the right pane or using the project tree on the left. As you select a folder, its contents is displayed in the right pane. The toolbar shows the name of the current folder.</p>
<br />
<p class="first"><strong> Alternate navigation</strong></p>
<p class="first">The toolbar includes a <em>Folder-Up</em> button. You can use this button or the <b> backspace</b> button to navigate up the project tree. You can also go directly to the root of the project by selection <em>Goto Root</em> from the <em>Folder</em> menu. Or, you can do the same through the tree-view pane.</p><br />

<h2>Sorting Files</h2>
<p class="first">You can sort the display by clicking on  any of the column headings. The sort can be ascending or decending. You can resize the columns by dragging the dividers. Both the  sort order and column widths are remembered across sessions--as is the placement and the size of the main window.</p>
<p>Note: 
<ul>
<li>You can use primary and secondary sort keys. For instance if you first sort by <i>File Name</i> and then re-sort by <i>Type</i>, the files that have the same type will preserve their alphabetical order (File Name will be the secondary sort key). </li>
<li>Sorting also works in other panes and areas. A useful technique in the Check-In area is to first sort by <i>File Name</i> and then by <i>Path</i>.</li>
