<h1>Projects Tab</h1>
<p>
In the Projects Tab you can see the list of all the projects on your machine. 
</p>
<p class="image">
<img src="../Images/project.gif" alt ="Project area" width=386 height=324 hspace="5" vspace="10" border=1 />
</p>
<p>
You can navigate between projects simply by double-clicking them. Notice that projects with unprocessed incoming scripts are marked with a colorful wave. Similarly, the icons of projects with files checked out are yellow.
</p>

<p>
The tab itself is marked with a red dot if there are waiting scripts in any of the projects. A green dot signifies the project that you have open currently. No dot means that the project doesn't require any action from the user.
</p>

<h2>Details Pane</h2>
<p>
The Details pane at the bottom of the Projects tab shows  the currently active and recently visited projects and their status.
