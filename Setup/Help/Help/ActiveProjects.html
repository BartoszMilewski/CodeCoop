<h1>Active Projects Pane</h1>
<p>In the Files View and the Projects View, the bottom pane lists currently active projects. Active projects are the ones that require user action as well as recently visited projects. You can switch to any one of these projects easily by double-clicking on it. You will also notice that the project icon indicates the project status&mdash;specifically whether there are files checked out or if there are incoming scripts in the project.</p>
