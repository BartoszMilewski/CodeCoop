<h1>Restoring old Versions of the Project</h1>
<p class="first">You can send the whole project back in time to any of the previous versions stored in History, whether it's just undoing the last check-in or one from a couple weeks or months back.. </p>
<br />
<h3>To restore a project</h3>
<ul>
	<li><span class="first">Select the version in <a  href="HistoryTab.html">History</a> you wish to undo and choose <em>Selection &gt; Restore</em>.</span> 
		<ul>
			<li> If History is <a  href="FileHistory.html">filtered</a>, only the selected files will be restored.</li>
			<li><span class="first">Files that haven't  changed since the selected version are not restored&mdash;there's nothing to restore!</span></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The restored files will be listed in the <strong>Check-in Area</strong>. You can review the results of the restore by double-clicking the files. You can also make additional changes.</li>
	<li>To propogate the restore to others you must <em>check-in</em> the files. Or, you can abandon the restore by doing an <em>Un-Checkout</em> of the files </li>
</ul>
 
<p class="first"> Incidentally, if you change your mind later, you can still undo the restoration by restoring the version before your restoration.</p>
<p>You can also restore individual files by selecting them in the lower pane and selecting <i>Restore File Version</p> from the <i>Selection</i> menu.
