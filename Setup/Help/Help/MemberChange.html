<h1>Membership Changes</h1>
<p class="first">Every member of the project may change his or her membership data (name, comment, etc.) by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>From the menu select <em>Project</em> &gt; <em>Members</em> </li>
	<li>Your enlistment is highlighted by default</li>
	<li>Make any changes you wish. This can include changing your status between Observer and Voting member</li>
	<li>Accept the change. A script will be sent to other members with the changes. </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h2>Administrator Privileges </h2>
<p class="first">Only the <b>Administrator</b> has the option to edit anybody's membership data. The administrator may also <b>remove members</b> from the project (radio button <em>Remove from Project</em> in the same dialog). The Administrator may make somebody else an administrator by selecting him or her from the Members dialog and clicking the <em>Administrator</em> radio button.</p>

<br />
<h2>Emergency Administrator Election</h2>

<p class="first">Sometimes an Administrator leaves the project without defecting, or goes on vacation without changing his or her status to <em>Observer</em>. This can be a problem when somebody else wants to join the project. In that case you will have to elect a new administrator. </p>
<br/>
<p class="first">To elect a new administrator, do the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>From the menu select <em>Project</em> &gt; <em>Administrator</em></li>
	<li>Click the &quot;Elect new Admin&quot; button. <span class="first">Use this option with caution, possibly after discussing it with other members of the project. The new administrator is selected automatically. This new Admin can later transfer the administrator status to any (non-observer) member of the project.</span>
</li>
</ul>
