<h1>Licensing</h1>

<p class="first">After the trial period, if you want to continue using Code Co-op, you will have to purchase a license from <a href="https://www.relisoft.com/secure/">Reliable Software</a>. You enter the license information in the dialog displayed through <em>License</em> in the <em>Program</em> menu. You will need at least as many licenses as there are <b>Voting Members</b> in a given project (Observers don't need licenses). The same license can be used in any number of projects on a given workstation. If there aren't enough licensed seats in a project, Code Co-op will force the status change of some members to <a href="Observer.html">Observer</a>. These members can recover their voting rights after purchasing and entering their licenses.
</p>
  <br />
	<h2>Distribution License</h2>
	<p class="first">In situations where you are using Code Co-op to distribute source code to clients through Distribution Projects, you will need a distribution license for each recipient (client). These licenses are sold at a discount. More information can be found on our web site <a href="http://www.relisoft.com/co_op/distribution.html">www.relisoft.com</a>. (Our RSWL library is distributed that way.)</p>
