<h1>Branch Merge Tab</h1>
<p>The branch merge area is used for merging branches. There are two types of branch merges:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="LocalMerge.html">Local merges</a>&mdash;merging branches created due to <a 			href="LocalBranch.html">script conflicts</a>. These merges can be also performed directly in the History tab, allbeit with fewer options.</li>
	<li><a href="ProjectMerge.html">Inter-project merges</a>&mdash;merging changes between related <a href="branch.html">branch projects</a>.
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="image">

</p>
<p class="caption">This is an example of a local merge. When a file is selected from the Branch, you will notice that the target project is &quot;Current Project&quot;. The toolbar in the lower pane also shows several functions that can be performed including Merge Branch files, Auto-Merge branch files, save and more. </p>
</div>
<h2>Local Merges </h2>
<p>
For local merges, you can select any scripted marked <em>Branch</em> in the upper pane (in greyed-out italics) to be merged with the current version. (as shown above). You will notice in the lower pane's toolbar the target project is &quot;<em>Current Project</em>&quot;. You want <em>Current Project </em>because you need to merge the local branch back into the trunk of this current project.
</p>
<h2>Inter-project Merges </h2>
<p>
See <a href="ProjectMerge.html">Project Merge</a>.
</p>
<h3>Lower Pane  Functions</h3>
<p>
Once you have selected the script/s, you can select a file in the lower pane. You have several functions that you can perform which are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="mergeVersion.html"><img src="../Images/mergebranch.gif" alt="Merge Branch button" width="15" height="16" hspace="2" border="0" /> Merge Branches files</a> </li>
	<li><a href="mergeVersion.html"><em><img src="../Images/automergebranch.gif" alt="Merge Branch button" width="20" height="17" border="0" /></em> Automatically Merge Branches</a></li>
	<li><img src="../Images/checkinOpen.gif" />View  Source branch changes</li>
	<li><img src="../Images/save_button.gif" /> Save version of file</li>
	<li><img src="../Images/historyFilter.gif" /> Filter History by selected file and Unfilter History </li>
	<li><img src="../Images/copyclip_button.gif" /> Copy selected list to Clipboard   </li>
</ul>
