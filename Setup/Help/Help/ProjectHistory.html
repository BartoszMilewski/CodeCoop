<h1>Looking at Project History</h1>
<p>
In the <a href="HistoryTab.html">History</a> area you can look at the past versions of your project. Each version corresponds to a script that created it, and is labeled with the check-in <b>comment</b> from that script (and a unique <b>script id</b>).
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>To  view the details of a script:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Select any script to view the files affected by that check-in in the Details pane at the bottom </li>
	<li>Double-clicking a file in the Details pane will launch the visual differ where you can see the changes made by the selected script </li>
	<li>From  the Details pane you can choose to save copies of selected files to a specified location </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>To view changes made since a certain version:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Select the version from which you want to start </li>
	<li>Select  <em>Show changes since this script... </em> from the <em>Selection</em> menu or <em>Context</em> menu </li>
	<li>The list of files that have  changed since this version will be listed in the Details pane.</li>
	<li>Double-click on any of the files in the list to view the cumulative differences. </li>
	<li>From the Details pane you can choose to save copies of selected files to a specified location </li>
</ul>
<br />

<h2>Calling history from the Files Tab</h2>
<p>Another approach for viewing history is to first select a file (or files) in the<strong> Files tab</strong>, and then click the <em>Show History</em> button. You'll be shown all the scripts that changed the selected file(s). You'll notice that the dropdown <i>History of:</i> will list the selected file(s). This is called a "history filter"--you can turn it off by selecting the "*.*" entry from the dropdown.</p>
