<h1>Importing Project History</h1>
<p class="first">When you join a project, your project history is initially empty. If you need access to the history of the project prior to your joining, you can import the history from another project member. </p>
<p>First, have another  project member  <a href="ExportHistory.html">export</a> their history and send it to you. Generally, the Admin  has the longest project history. Then, when you receive the project history,  incorporate it into your project by selecting <em>Import History</em> from the <em>History</em> menu (you will be prompted for the file name). </p>
<br/>
<p class="first">Note: Your history and the imported history must partially overlap for the Import to work. In particular, you cannot import a history file created <em>before you joined</em> the project.</p>
