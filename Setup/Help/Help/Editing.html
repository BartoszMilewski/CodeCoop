<h1>Viewing and Editing Files</h1>
<p class="first">You can view any file in the project by double-clicking it (or selecting <em>Open</em> from the <em>Selection</em> menu). If the file is checked out, you can edit it. Code Co-op has a built-in <a href="Differ.html">editor/differ</a> for that purpose. If the file is not checked out, typing within the editor will  prompt you to check out the file. </p>
<br />

<h2>SCC Compliant Editors</h2>
<p class="first">If your editor or IDE is <a href="integrate.html">SCC compliant</a>, you'll be able to perform source-control operations  from within it to allow you to edit your files. </p>
<br/>
<h2>Opening  Files with Shell Association </h2>
<p class="first"> Double-clicking on a binary file will start the application that is associated (in your shell) with the particular extension. For instance, Microsoft Word files with the extension .doc will be opened using Microsoft Word, etc. Non-binary files may  be opened using the shell by selecting <em>Open With Shell</em> from their context menu or pressing Ctrl+Enter. </p>
