<h1>Project Invitation</h1>

<h2>Inviting a Project Member </h2>
<p>
The administator can invite a new project member to join the project. An invitation script is sent to the invitee with all the data needed to create a project enlistment.
 
<p><i>Note: Do not send invitation in response to a <b>join request</b>. Just unpack the request.</i></p>

<p>You can Invite a person to the project by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Select Project &gt; Invite</li>
	<li>Fill in their name	</li>
	<li>Select the destination address: 
		<ul>
			<li>In Code Co-op Lite, type in the email address of the invitee
			<li>In Code Co-op Pro, specify if the invitee is a satellite or an e-mail peer/hub
			<li>If the user is a <strong>satellite</strong>: Select &quot;The invited user is a satellite&quot; and enter their Hub's e-mail address and the satellite's <a href="ComputerName.html">Computer Name</a>. </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Select OK.</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>
After you Ok this dialog, Code Co-op wraps up the project and sends it to the new project member.
</p>

<h2>Options</h2>
<p>
In the "Options" tab (version Pro only) you may select an alternative way of propagating the invitation: You can save it to the local disk, CD, network share; or upload it to an FTP site:
</p>

</p>
<p>
You also have the option of exporting your history for the invitee to import.
</p>
<p>
When you <b>save</b> the invitation, you are responsible for notifying the invitee. The invitee must then use Code Co-op's <a href="OpenInvitation.html">Project>Open Invitation</a> menu item to (download and) accept it.
</p>
<p class="note"><small>Note: When inviting a satellite user, it is very important to deliver the invitation to their Hub and <i>not</i> directly to the Satellite. The invitation contains important routing information for the Hub, without which it wouldn't be able to forward scripts to the Satellite.</small></p>
<p>
The exported history can be copied anywhere on the invitee's machine and <a href="ImportHistory.html">imported</a> into the project in question.
</p>

<h2>Receiving an Invitation </h2>
<p
>When you receive an Invitation, you are notified by the dispatcher:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A little balloon from the dispatcher in your system tray will appear stating: <em>Invitation: Path to Root Folder Needed</em>. Click on the balloon to enter the location where you want to store your project files. </li>
	<li>If no action is taken at the balloon prompt, the dispatcher window will open to the quarantine tab. You will see listed there a script with the status &quot;Processing of an Invitation Failed&quot;. Double click on the script to release it from <a href="Dispatcher.html">Quarantine</a>. You will then be prompted again for the location where you want to store the project files. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a good reason, you can always reject the invitation by checking the <em>Reject</em> button.</p>
