<h1>Adding Existing Files and Folders</h1>
<p>If a file has been created outside of Code Co-op's control and saved within a project tree, it doesn't automatically become part of your project. You have to <i>Add</i> it to the project. From within the <a href="FilesTab.html">Files</a> area, select the file(s) and click the <em>Add To Project</em> button. Other members of the team will learn about this addition after you make your next <a href="CheckIn.html">check-in</a>.</p>

</p>

<p>You may also add a whole <b>folder</b> to the project. When you select a folder and click on the <i>Add To Project</i> button, you will be given a choice as to which files in that folder (and its sub-folders) to add. You'll be able to select groups of files to be added either by extension or individually.
