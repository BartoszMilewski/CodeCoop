<h1>Search With Shell</h1>
<p class="first">You can use Windows search capabilities from inside Code Co-op. Select a folder you want to search (either in the folder pane or in the file pane), right click to display the context menu, and select "Search With Shell". Windows will then display its own search UI, which lets you search files by name or by contents.</p>
