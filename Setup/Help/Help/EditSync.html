<h1>Editing an Incoming Script</h1>
<p class="first">When you have an incoming script in your Inbox, you have the option to make edits to the affected files as you review the changes.</p>
<br/>
<p class="first">To edit the sync script:
<ul>
	<li>Select the script in the Inbox</li>
	<li>From the Selection or context menu select <em>Edit Sync</em></li>
	<li>You will be taken to the Synch Merge tab where you can double-click each file and make edits using the visual differ</li>
	<li>Click the Accept Changes button in the toolbar or call it from the context or Selection menu to sync the incoming sync changes </li>
	<li>Go to the Check-in tab to <a href="checkin.html">Check-in</a> and propogate the changes just made to other members of the project</li>
</ul>
Note: If you are using the built-in differ, you can also edit sync changes from the History Area, after they've been accepted. You won't be editing the script but the <i>Current</i> version of the file shown side-by-side with the script's changes.
