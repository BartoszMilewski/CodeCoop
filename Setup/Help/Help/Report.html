<h1>Creating Reports</h1>
<p class="first">Code Co-op has rudimentary reporting capabilities. If you select <em>Report</em> from the <em>Selection</em> or <em>All</em> menu, you'll be able to save the data from the current view to a file. This is particularly useful in History view. The file contains tab-separated columns, best viewed by importing it into a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>For diagnostics purposes, Code Co-op has the <em>Save Diagnostics...</em> item in the <em>Help</em> menu. Reliable Software support might ask you to email the results of diagnostics in order to help you resolve a problem.</p>
