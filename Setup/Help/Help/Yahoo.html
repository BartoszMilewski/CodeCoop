<h1>Yahoo Mail</h1>
<p class="first">In order to use Yahoo email over POP3/SMTP, you need to install <a href="http://ypops.sourceforge.net/index.php">YPOPs</a>. After you install YPOPs, you need to configure the dispatcher.</p>
<br/>
<p class="first">After YPOPs is installed, configure the dispatcher as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p class="first"> Click the dispatcher icon on the system tray and select the Collaboration Wizard</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p class="first">Select &quot;Using email for collaboration&quot; if it isn't already selected</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p class="first">Select &quot;I have a POP3/SMTP account for use by Code Co-op&quot;</p>
	</li>
	<li>Fill in your email address</li>
	<li>The POP and SMTP server settings are 127.0.0.1</li>
	<li>The SMTP server does not require authentication. Do not check this box. </li>
	<li>When you are done, click Next.</li>
	<li>Test your settings by clicking &quot;Run Diagnostics&quot;</li>
	<li>Once you get confirmation that it passes, click next to configure email settings and finish.</li>
</ul>
<p class="first"><em>Known Issues:</em> Yahoo released their beta which doesn't currently work with YPOPs. If you are using the new beta, you will need to revert back to the previous version of Yahoo. You do this by logging on to Yahoo from your web browser. Click &quot;<em>Switch back</em>&quot; at the top of the page. </p>
<br/>
<h2>Yahoo Mail Plus</h2>
The paid version of Yahoo Mail is supposed to support SMTP/POP3, but we haven't tested it with Code Co-op.
