<h1>Restore From Backup</h1>
	<em><span style="color: dodgerblue">(This feature is not available in Code Co-op Lite)<br />
	</span></em>
	<br />
<p>The archive created with <a href="CreateBackup.html">Tools > Create Backup</a> can be used to restore the complete Code Co-op database with all the projects present on the machine at the time of backup. This is useful in two situations:
<ul>
	<li>The machine crashed and the disk is not recoverable</li>
	<li>You are moving the database to another computer.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Before you restore from backup file, make sure the computer doesn't already have a non-empty Code Co-op database. The restoration may only proceed on a <b>fresh installation of Code Co-op</b>. 
</p>
<p>You will first be asked for the location of the backup (see dialog below). If the backup is stored on the internet, it will be downloaded using FTP.</p>

<p>Once the database has been restored, Code Co-op enters the stage of <b>project recovery</b>. First it tries to recreate project roots, and if it can't, the <a href="VerifyRootPaths.html">Verify Root Paths</a> dialog is displayed, prompting for new locations. Next, Code Co-op sends a <a href="RequestVerification.html">Verification Request</a> for each project. Until verification scripts are received, all check-ins are blocked. (Making a check-in from a project that is not up to date risks massive rejections of historical scripts.)

Finally, Code Co-op visits all the projects and performs <a href="RepairProject.html">Project Repair</a>. This step might take a long time. </p>

<p>Warning: If you are using Backup/Restore to <a href="MoveProjects.html">move Code Co-op to a different computer</a>, make sure not to perform any Code Co-op actions on the source machine, after restoring the database on the target machine. The only thing you can do on the source machine is to uninstall Code Co-op <b>without defecting</b> from any projects.
