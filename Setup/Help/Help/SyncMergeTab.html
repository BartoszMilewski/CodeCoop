<h1>Sync Merge Tab</h1>
<p>
The Sync Merge  tab appears dynamically after an incoming script is executed and it affects at least one file that you already have checked out and edited. Code Co-op attempts to automatically perform the merges. In some cases a merge conflict is detected and the file state is c marked as <b>conflict</b>.
</p>
<p>
The sync merge tab enables you to examine and modify the <a href="merge.html">results of the merge</a>. Double-clicking on a file will open the merger to show you the script changes and your local changes.
</p>

</p>
<p>Although in general reviewing merge results is optional, if there are any files with the <b>conflict</b> status, they <i>must be</i> reviewed and the conflicts resolved, otherwise you won't be able to accept the sync, and the Sync Merge area will remain open.

<p>Script comment is displayed in the toolbar. You can expand it by clicking the down arrow to the right of it.</p>
<p>After you've reviewed the merge, you can choose to:
<ul>
<li><img src="../Images/acceptchange.gif" alt="Accept All Files" width="16" height="19" hspace="3" align="default" />Accept Changes to all files, which is the most common operation. </li>
<li><img src="../Images/acceptselect.gif" alt="Accept Selected Files" width="17" height="18" hspace="3" />Accept Changes to Selected Files</li>
</ul>
</p>
