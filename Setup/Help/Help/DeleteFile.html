<h1>Deleting a File</h1>
<p>To delete a file (or a whole folder) do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Menu <em>Selection</em> &gt; <em>Delete</em> </li>
	<li>Click on the <em>Delete</em> button in the toolbar</li>
	<li>Press the <b>Del</b> key</li>
</ul>
<p> You will still see the deleted file or folder in the <strong>Check-in area</strong>. </p>
<h2>Restoring a Deleted File </h2>
<p>If you change your mind about deleting a file before you check it in, you can easily restore it. Select the deleted file in the check-in area and click on the <em>Un-CheckOut</em> button, or use <em>Un-CheckOut</em> from the <em>Selection</em> menu.</p>
<h2>Removing a File from Code Co-op control</h2>
<p>You also have the option to remove a file from Code Co-op control
without deleting it (<em>Make Uncontrolled</em> in the <em>Selection</em> menu). 
The file will  likewise be removed from Code Co-op control in all the other members' enlistments,
after you've send them the check-in script. It won't be physically <b>deleted</b>, though.</p>

<h2>Retrieving a Deleted File</h2>
<p> When you delete a file in Code Co-op, the file is never lost. When a file is deleted, it will no longer be visible in your project, but all the previous versions of that file will be available through <b>History</b>.</p>

<p>To retrieve an older version of the deleted file, select the script that deleted it. You'll see the file in the lower pane as "deleted". Select the file and use <b>Restore file version</b> from the <b>Selection</b> menu. You can also save the file outside of the project using the menu item <b>Save file version</b>.
