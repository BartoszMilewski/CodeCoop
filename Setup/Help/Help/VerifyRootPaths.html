<h1>Verify Root Paths</h1>
<p>It may happen that the drive where project sources were stored is no longer accessible. It could have been a removable drive, network drive, or a hard drive that no longer exists. In that case you may use the menu item <b>Project>Verify Root Paths</b> to check root paths of all projects in one go. If the root drive(s) are not accessible, you will have the opportunity to change them.</p>

<p>The same dialog is displayed when Code Co-op database is <a href="RestoreFromBackup.html">restored from backup</a> on a machine different from the original, and a particular drive (or drives) don't exist. 
</p>
<p>After the root drive(s) are modified, it is usually necessary to run <a href="RepairProject.html">Project Repair</a> to restore all project files from the database.
