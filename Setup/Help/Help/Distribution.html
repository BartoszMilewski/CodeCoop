<h1>Distribution Projects </h1>
<p>Distribution projects are useful when you are selling source code to clients. A distributon project gives you a controlled way to automatically distribute source code changes (patches) to your clients. Your clients will not be aware of each other, and they won't be able to make any changes to the project.</p>

<p>Here is how it works:
<ul>
  <li>Create a project containing the source code, with the option &quot;Distribution project&quot; (there is an &quot;Options&quot; tab in the Project&gt;New dialog). </li>
  <li>Ask your clients to install free evaluation copies of Code Co-op. </li>
  <li>Ask your clients to join the distribution project. </li>
  <li>When the join request arrives, the Distribution Administrator has the choice to accept the join which makes the joiner a &quot;Receiver&quot; and transfers to him/her a <i>distribution license</i> already purchased by your company (these licenses are cheaper than the full Code Co-op license). </li>
  <li>Receivers are passive members of the project. They cannot check files out or modify their own membership status. They don't see other receivers in the project membership list. </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Setting up Distribution Projects</h3>
<p>
When you create a new project you can designate it to be a distribution project
 from the <em>Options tab</em> in the New Project dialog as shown here.

</p>

<p>
You have the option to prevent a Receiver from branching the project. You can also choose to send out one e-mail per script to all receivers in the distribution project, or you can send out individual e-mails.</p>
<p>You can also designate a project to be a distribution project after it has been created, although you have to be the <em>only</em> member of the project. To do this select <em>Project &gt; Options</em> and click on the <em>Distribution Tab</em>. You will have the same options as you see in the above screen capture.
