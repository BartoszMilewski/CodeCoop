<h1>Creating a Brand New Project</h1>
<p>When you create a new project, Code Co-op creates:
<ul>
	<li><span class="first">a database where all project data will be kept </span></li>
	<li>a project files directory &mdash; the root of the project which you define&mdash;and its subdirectories where your source files are stored.</li>
</ul>
You'll be able to access these files using your editor or a development environment. Code Co-op will make them read-only in order to protect them from being edited without you first <a href="CheckOut.html">checking them out</a>. If you already have a source tree, you may create a Code Co-op project starting at the root of that tree. During the creation of the project you'll be asked which of the existing files are to be added to the project. Don't add to project files that are (re-)generated during the build.
</p>
<h2>How to Create a Project</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Select <em>New</em> from the <em>Project</em> menu</li>
	<li>In the <em>New Project</em> dialog you'll have to answer a few straightforward questions:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Where to find or create your project tree.</strong> You may specify any folder that's not already part of another project. If that folder doesn't exist, Co-op will create it for you. Or, you may choose a folder that's already populated with files.</li>
			<li>Unique <b>project name</b>--other members will use this name to join your project.</li>
			<li>Your <b>personal data</b>--your name and Comment or  phone number. This personal information will be  available to every member of your project (under <em>Project</em> &gt; <em>Members</em> )
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
 <br />

<h2>Project Options</h2>
<p> During the creation process, you can set some additional project options. The <em>Options</em> tab of the <em>New Project</em> dialog gives you the following  choices:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Automation Options:
		<ul>
			<li>Automatically execute <em>all incoming  synchronization</em> scripts</li>
			<li>Automatically accept all Join Requests </li>
			<li>Keep files checked out after each check-in </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Special Project types
		<ul>
			<li>Create a <a href="WikiProject.html">Wiki project</a> </li>
			<li>Create a <a href="Distribution.html">Distribution Project</a><br />
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
