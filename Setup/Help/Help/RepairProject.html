<h1>Repairing a Project</h1>
<p class="first">Code Co-op is based on reliable transactional database technology. The program's only Achilles heel is user files. If you modify a file without checking it out, the consistency of the project will be (temporarily) compromised. You'll discover it the next time you try to check out the corrupted file or when a script arrives that modifies this file.</p>
<p>Don't despair, though. Code Co-op stores enough redundant information in its database to be able to recover the file. Just run <em>Repair</em> from the <em>Project</em> menu. In fact, you might run Repair from time to time, just to make sure none of your programming tools try to modify read-only files. </p>
<p>In most cases, when Code Co-op detects corrupted files, you should let it repair them. If the project has been joined using an older version of Code Co-op, immediate repair might be impossible. In that case, you'll have to obtain specific versions of the corrupted files from other project members. Code Co-op will instruct you how to do it (see also <a href="RestoreVersion.html">recreating</a> old versions of files).</p>
