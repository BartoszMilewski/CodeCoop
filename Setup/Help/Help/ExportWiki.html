<h1>Export Wiki Site as HTML</h1>
<p class="first">A wiki site that is part of your project can only be viewed using Code Co-op. If you want to make it available outside of your team of Code Co-op users, you can convert it into HTML and deploy it on your web site.</p>
<p>To convert a wiki site, select <i>Export Wiki as HTML...</i> item from the <i>Folder</i> menu. All you need is to provide the path where the HTML files are to be stored. The current wiki site (the one displayed in the browser) will be converted to HTML and exported, complete with the stylesheet and images. You can just treecopy it to your web server and it will be immediately browsable.</p>
<p>The conversion has certain limitations. Pages that contain SQWiki SELECT statements (SQL-like database queries) will be expanded into HTML tables that display the snapshot of the database. Forms that query the wiki datbases or insert records will not work in their HTML form.</p>
