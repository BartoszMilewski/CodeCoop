 bool less (int i, int j)
 {
     return i < j;
 }| &nbsp; bool less (int i, int j)<br/>
&nbsp; {<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return i &lt; j;<br/>
&nbsp; }<br/> | Preformatted<br/>''Start lines with whitespace'' |
<small>Note: Inside a preformatted block, less-than signs, &lt;, are not treated as HTML markup. Wiki markup is still acceptable.</small>

==Character Formatting
|! Display | Markup | Description |
| ''italics'' | <nowiki>''italics''</nowiki> | Two apostrophes on both sides |
| '''bold''' | <nowiki>'''bold'''</nowiki> | Three apostrophes |
| ''''bold italic'''' | <nowiki>''''bold italic''''</nowiki> | Four apostrophes |

==Wiki Links
Wiki links are of the form 
    <nowiki>[[another page]]</nowiki>. 
You can create such a link even if the target page doesn't exist (in fact, this is the preferred way of creating new pages). The first time you click on a non-existing wiki link, an empty wiki page is created in the current directory and the editor is open on this page. The new file, in this case "another page.wiki", is added to project (it will be visible in the check-in area, ready to be checked in).

A wiki link may contain alternative text after the ''pipe'' sign, like this 
    <nowiki>[[another page| Don't Click Me]]</nowiki>. 
This link appears on the page as: [[another page| Don't Click Me]], even though it points to (absent!) ''another page.wiki''.
| Note: If you look at the source wiki file for this help, you'll see the links with the prefix '''system:'''. This is because wiki help is not part of your project, but it's located in the system directory. Normally you don't use ''system'' links.|

==Namespaces
An internal link may have a ''namespace'' component, equivalent of putting the wiki file in a separate subdirectory. For instance, if you create a link:
 <nowiki>[[bug:wrong icon]]</nowiki>
and click on it the first time, a file ''wrong icon.wiki'' will be created in the subdirectory ''bug''. Some namespeces, such as ''Image'' and ''Delete'' are reserved (see topic below). Clicking on a link that has a prefix '''Delete:''' results in file deletion.

==Templates
When a wiki directory contains a file named ''template.wiki'' its contents will be used to initialize every new wiki file created through a link. In particular, you might find it useful to create a template file in a subdirectory/namespace. In that case, every file created in this namespace will be appropriately initialized. For instance, here's a To Do List template: [[system:ToDo:template|ToDo:template]]. Every new file created using the ''ToDo'' namespace, will be initialized with the contenst of ''ToDo\template.wiki''.

==Images
To embed an image, use a wiki link with the ''Image:'' namespace prefix. For instance, 
    <nowiki>[[Image:My Photo]]</nowiki>. 
The first time you click on such a link, a dialog appears, prompting you to find the intended image anywhere on your disk. This image is then be copied to the ''Image'' subdirectory of the current directory (it will also be added to the project). Once the image file is present in the ''Image'' subdirectory, the picture is automaticall displayed in the source page. Note: the image file may have any extension that is understood by the browser, for instance .gif, .jpg, .png, etc. 

An image link may contain alternative text after the ''pipe'' sign, e.g., 
    <nowiki>[[Image:My Photo| It's me!]]</nowiki>. 
The alternative text is displayed when the mouse hovers over the picture.

[[system:Image:Sunset| Tropical Sunset]]
 <nowiki>[[Image:Sunset| Tropical Sunset]]</nowiki>
==External Links
To create a link to an external page, enclose it in single brackets. You can also provide an alternative text after the ''pipe'' sign. For instance, the following link
    <nowiki>[http://www.relisoft.com|Reliable Software]</nowiki>
is displayed as [http://www.relisoft.com|Reliable Software]. Note: only strings starting with internet transport prefixes, like 
|http:| ftp:| https:| ftps:| mailto:| news: | snews: | file: |
are treated as links. Otherwise, single brackets are displayed normally, as in A[0]. 

The ''file:'' prefix is used to link to local files. According to standards, ''file:'' has to be followed by triple slash and a full path, e.g., <nowiki>[file:///c:/documents/word.doc]</nowiki>. Any type of file that has a shell association can be linked this way--for instance Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, HTML files, etc.

==Boxes, Tables, and Rules
To create a box like this:
| start and end a line with a vertical bar |

Similarly, to create a table, start each table row with a vertical bar. Separate items in a row with vertical bars. For instance, the following markup:
 | one   | two  |
 | three | four |
is displayed as
| one    | two |
| three | four |
To make a table heading, follow the vertical bar with an exclamation mark. For instance:
 |! Country |! Language |
 |  USA     |  English  |
is displayed as:
|! Country |! Language |
| United States | American English |
You can have multi-line entries in a table. There is even a trick to start an entry on a new line. Just type a space after the opeining vertical bar, so it won't be confused with the closing bar. Use this trick, for instance, to include pre-formatted text in a table. For instance, this code:
 | Next entry is pre-formatted | 
 previous line ends in a space! |
Produces this display:
| Next entry is pre-formatted | 
 previous line ends in a space! |
Without the trailing space in the first line, the display looks like this:
| Next entry is pre-formatted |
 previous line doesn't end in a space! |
---
To make a horizontal rule (like the one above), start a line with three hyphens: ---.
==No Wiki
To turn off the wiki interpretation of markup, put it between &lt;nowiki&gt; and &lt;/nowiki&gt; tags.
==HTML Markup
As long as it doesn't interfere with wiki markup, standard HTML markup may be embedded in .wiki files. For instance <span style="color:#d90;font-family:serif;">'''Orange Serif'''</span> is encoded as
 <nowiki>&lt;span style="color:#d90;font-family:serif;"&gt;'''Orange Serif'''&lt;/span&gt;</nowiki>
You can also use JavaScript inside wiki files.
==HTML Export and Printing
You an export a wiki site from Code Co-op as a set of HTML files and, for instance, post them on a web site. All the internal links will be functional, and all the images exported too.

To print a page as displayed in the browser, right click inside the page and select "Print...".
==Sqwiki
[[system:Sqwiki Help| Sqwiki]] (pronounced ''squeaki'') is our simplified SQL database language. 
==Forms
You can create [[system:Forms Help| wiki forms]] using HTML. A form may be submitted to another wiki file--the results of the form can be accessed there using simple syntax.
