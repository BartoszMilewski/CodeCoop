==Description
There was a discussion in the forum about what font to use in a dialog and one interesting solution was this:
 LOGFONT lf; 
 ::GetObject(::GetStockObject(DEFAULT_GUI_FONT),sizeof(lf),&lf); 
We should look into it when creating dialogs from templates.
==Comments
Implemented in dialog template maker.
