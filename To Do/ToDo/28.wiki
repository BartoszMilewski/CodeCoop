==Description
Scanario: Users send invitations to the unattended server. As it is now, somebody has to go to the server and turn on auto-sync. 

It would be better to be able to pass this flag with the invitation. 

One could add a checkbox to invite, and pass a bit, similar to the observer bit.
==Resolution
This would require script version change. For now, we changed the processing of an invitation to set auto sync for an observer.
