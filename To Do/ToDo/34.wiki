==Description
| Do you have a document which explains in detail how the new branch/merging process works and what exactly is going on?  The online help from within the app seems very minimal.  It would be good if we could more completely understand it. |

| I was recently working on some code and noticed in coop when I went to 
accept an incoming script that I was asked to execute or postpone.  I 
clicked execute.  I then noticed a branch (italics entry) in the history.
So, I right-clicked it and selected merge to current version.  I 
thought I did everything correctly, but the history still shows it in italics.|
