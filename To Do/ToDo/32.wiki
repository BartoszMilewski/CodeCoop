==Description
In the invitation dialog and in the accept-join dialog, add option to store full sync somewhere else rather than in the public inbox, from where it is immediately emailed. The user can then copy it to a CD ROM or an FTP site and by-pass the email. 

== Implementation
Modify Project>Invite (don't bother with Join). Add a radio button to options:
* Save invitation to my disk -- I will copy it manually to the Public Inbox directory (usually c:\co-op\PublicInbox) on the new user's machine.
If the "satellite" radio button is checked, this text should end in "...on the new user's hub".

Important thing: turn off the script's forwarding flag, so the recipient's dispatcher doesn't complain about "new satellite user".
