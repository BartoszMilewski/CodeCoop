==Description
We have a problem when a hub moves. The new hub doesn't know about satellite receivers. The solution is for the satellites to send a satellite-to-hub script with a list of new user announcements (the standard dispatcher addendum sent when a new project is created on the satellite). The list would be created from the list of local enlistments.
