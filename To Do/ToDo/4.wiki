==Description 
It would be nice to have a tooltip in History/Merge view when the cursor lingers over a script. The tooltip would display the script comment in full.
==Resolution
Implemented so called label tip - unfolds obscured portion of the narrow column. Didn't implement list view item tooltip, because we don't have the access to the full script comment during notification.
