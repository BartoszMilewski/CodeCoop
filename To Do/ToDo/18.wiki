==Description
Introduce syntax for accessing properties stored in the registy (or overload <nowiki>[!prop]</nowiki>).
==Design Notes
* Introduce new type of link, <nowiki>[@prop]</nowiki>. The converter's sink will look the property up in co-op user registry, under key "wiki".
* If the value is not set, the sink will output a string that should trigger a syntax error in sqwiki. At the same time, this string should be informative to the user. "prop-name NOT set"?
* Setting of registry values can be done by extending the INSERT INTO command with a special table name that designates local registry. Maybe "REGISTRY" ?
