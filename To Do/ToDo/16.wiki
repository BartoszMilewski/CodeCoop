==Description
The wiki view should watch for WM_APPCOMMAND messages and handle APPCOMMAND_BROWSER_FORWARD/BACKWARD appropriately.

How do you generate such events? Backspace key?

I have a 5-button mouse and two of the buttons are linked to the 
forward/backward commands.  Some of the multimedia keyboards use them too.
