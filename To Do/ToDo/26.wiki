==Description
This should work:
 ? SELECT Summary FROM Feature WHERE FILENAME LIKE %<nowiki>[?FeatureName]</nowiki>%
So should this:
 ?SELECT Summary FROM Feature WHERE FILENAME LIKE <nowiki>[?FeatureName]</nowiki>
All this could be accomplished if the parser had a production for "Identifier" that would collect and concatenate tokens. I think the lexer already does the substiturion of <nowiki>[?FeatureName]</nowiki> in some cases.
