I would like to support the request for this feature, as nicely illustrated by Giles.

This functionality is not only useful for "blaming" purposes, but also for review and audit purposes.
For instance, if I want to make a formal review of all the source modifications between versions 2.3 and 2.4 of the product, I will select this range of versions in the co-op history, and code co-op nicely allows me to view the full change. But I cannot see the author or time at which a change was applied.

In the right pane of the differ, I would find it valuable to be able to show the script ID and author of the change on the right of the text.  For a collective review, the author can be asked to justify a change.

This "author header" feature would also be useful for novices not familiar yet with the yellow/pink color coding when reviewing an incoming script (i.e. label changed lines as "local" vs "incoming").


I believe this feature would have a real practical value...
