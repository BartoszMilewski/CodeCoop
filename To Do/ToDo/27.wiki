==Description
The option "auto accept invitations" is in Project>Options dialog and is not available when there are no projects. We may either make it available and grey out all the other options, or add a new item to Program>Options (duplicating the functionality present in Program>Options). That would make even more sense if we move some settings from Program>Options to the new ''Tools'' menu.
