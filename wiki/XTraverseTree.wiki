| Note: We are assuming that confirmed scripts form continuous paths from the root--there cannot be a non-confirmed script between confirmed ones in any branch. The tricky case is with missing scripts. Can a missing script be followed by a confirmed script? This cannot happen because, when a script is confirmed, all its predecessors are autmatically confirmed. This includes missing predecessors (they will still generate resend requests). Additionally, when a defect or remove script is added to the tree, all missing scripts are confirmed ''and'' marked ''don't request resend''.
