=Navigation
==Entering Wiki Directory
* '''BrowserPane''' is activated
* Calls WikiBrowserController::'''StartNavigation'''
* Posts the "Navigate" command to the executor with URL: current path + "index.wiki"
* Commander executes '''Navigate ()'''
* Calls UiManager::Navigate with URL and offset 0
* Calls down through Layout, Pane, to '''WikiBrowserController::Navigate'''
**  Sets _scrollPos (which is zero)
**  Calls web browser to Navigate to URL
* Notification: ''''BeforeNavigate''''
**  PostCommand '''OnBrowse''' with path and scroll offset of the ''previous'' page (zero)
* Commander processes '''OnBrowse''' with ''path'' and zero scroll offset
* Calls BrowserTable::PushPath
** Since _history is empty, pushes path with offset 0
** Sends external notification to update path in the toolbar
* Notification: ''''DocumentComplete''''
**  Scrolls to _scrollPos
**  Sets _scrollPos to 0

==Clicking a Wiki Link
* Notification: ''''BeforeNavigate''''
**  PostCommand '''OnBrowse''' with new path and scroll offset of the ''previous'' page
* Commander processes '''OnBrowse''' with path and previous scroll offset
* Calls BrowserTable::'''PushPath'''
** Old scroll offset is stored with last path
** Pushes new path on _history with scroll offset 0
** Sends external notification to update path in the toolbar
* Notification: ''''DocumentComplete''''
**  Scrolls to _scrollPos
**  Sets _scrollPos to 0

==Back
* Commander::'''Selection_Previous'''
** Pops path (together with its scroll offset) off BrowserTable
** Calls UiManager::Navigate
* Calls down through Layout, Pane, to '''WikiBrowserController::Navigate'''
**  Sets _scrollPos
**  Calls web browser to Navigate to URL
* Notification: ''''BeforeNavigate''''
**  PostCommand '''OnBrowse''' with path and scroll offset of the ''previous'' page
* Commander processes '''OnBrowse''' with path and scroll offset
* Calls BrowserTable::PushPath
** Since this is the same path as the top, does nothing
* Notification: ''''DocumentComplete''''
**  Scrolls to _scrollPos
**  Sets _scrollPos to 0

==Wiki File Modified Externally
* External notification 
** Directory notifies BrowserTable
** Notifies RecordSet
** Notifies WikiBrowser::UpdateIfNecessary (no topic)
** Notifies WikiBrowserController with topic: "browser"
* WikiBrowserController::Update
**  Retrieves current page's scroll position and stores it in _scrollPos
**  Calls web browser to Navigate to URL given by current _srcPath
* The rest is the same as in the previous case (''Back'')
