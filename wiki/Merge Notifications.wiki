=Merge Notifications
When the user merges files from a branch to the trunk, at some point the scripts should be marked as "merged" rather than "branch".

* "Merge branch files" from history or branch-merge area
** Manual merge: check out if necessary, attach info to check-in table with script ID
** Auto merge: check out if necessary, attach info. If the result of the merge is "conflict" attach conflict info to the check-in table entry for this file. Note: this should be done in either synchronous or asynchronous auto merge.
* Two panes in the check-in area. Files and Check-in Groups.
** File has "properties" in which the user can select to which group the file belongs or create a new group (new comment).
** Double-clicking on a group selects all files belonging to this group
** Lower pane has the selective check-in button.
* When checking in, the comments from groups that are involved are accumulated and shown as the comment in the check-in dialog.
** The branch scripts that were merged in this particular check-in are marked as "merged"
** The check-in script contains a new section with a list of merged scripts
* The receiver of the script marks the merged scripts in his history.

===Check In Area
* Create a real table for the check-in area (requires version change!)
* Store file ids and merge info for each (bitflag)
* A vector of "check-out groups", each with a list of files in it
===History
* New bit "merged"
===Script
* New section with a list of merged scripts
