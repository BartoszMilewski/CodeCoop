==Import History
===Problem
Commander::History_ImportHistory performs a long operation--the download of a large file, possibly from FTP--while blocking the message loop. That disables SCC actions. 
===Proposed Solution
* If FTP or LAN download, create a separate thread with the progress meter and FTP site, and throw SwitchToCmdLine exception.
* Catch this exception in the controller, switch to command line to block input, set focus forwarding to the progress meter dialog.
* When download finished, the thread posts message ExecuteCommand Import History with the temporary path.
* When processing this message, move temporary path to InputSource, Switch to GUI, and call Commander::History_ImportHistory.
* This time the path is retrieved from the InputSource and, since it's local, Model::ImportHistory is performed.
