=Bartosz: To Do
===Wiki
* Find out if it's possilbe to change the processor so that file renaming is not necessary. In some project the preprocessor shouldn't be called at all.
* Add "delete" button to browser view. It deletes the currently viewed wiki file. The browser then navigates to the previously browsed file. If the file index.wiki is deleted, there is a confirmation popup and the browser pane is closed.
* Command: Folder>Make Wiki. Create index.wiki in the current folder.
* Record parser: allow spaces in field names
* Record parser: ignore everything after table end
* Specify Arial as default font in wiki css
===Differ
* Tabs for ''before'' and ''after'' versions of the file
===UI
* '''Icons''' in script details (and other toolbars?)
* '''Script conflict dialog''' - review dialog messages and help message.
