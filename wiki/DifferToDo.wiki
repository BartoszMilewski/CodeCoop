=Differ: To Do
== Setup
* Installer.cpp
* Installer::SetupRegistry
** change SetAlternativeDiffer for BcMergerExe to SetBcDiffer -- set the UseXml flag in registry
** SetAlternativeMerger -> SetBcMerger
** SetAlternativeAutoMerger remove for BcMergerExe
* Installer::PerformInstallation
** ConfigDefaultDifferMerger
** SetUpOurAltDifferMerger
| SetupRegistry is called first, the ConfigDefaultDifferMerger. They seem to be overlapping. |
== 
* ExecuteDiffer (MergerProxy.cpp)
* UsesAltDiffer (AltDiffer.cpp) should take ''bool & useXml''
* If useXml true, then go through ExecuteBuiltInDiffer
* ExecuteBuiltInDiffer should take the path (for our differ, it's "Differ")
* create SharedMem buffer
* Same thing with ExecuteMerger and UsesAltMerger
