<h1>Destination computer</h1>
<h2>Possible situations</h2>
*Invitation Full Synch is received as a single script
*Invitation Full synch is received in chunks
*More than one invitation Full Synch received at the same time, possibly concerning a single project
<h2>Sequence of events</h2>
when Dispatcher receives an invitation script/chunk and processes a target computer addendum for the first time:
* addressee is found on a local recipient list
** copy a script to the enlistment inbox
* addressee not found on a local recipient list
** display a join dialog (only project root available for editing)
** <i>Revisit: what if the dialog is cancelled?</i>
** ask co-op to create a project
** copy the invitation script to the enlistment inbox

<h2>Life's not that easy!</h2>
If addressee is not found on a local recipient list:
* don't display a Join dialog again
**ignore all successive invitation chunks adressed to this user in this project
* don't display Undeliverable script dialog
** ignore the original invitation script/chunk
** ignore all successive invitation chunks addressed to this user in this project
*after calling co-op, Dispatcher has to wait until Co-op actually creates the project infrastructure before it can copy the script.

<h2>Solution</h2>
* display a join dialog (only project root available for editing)
* add a fake entry describing a new user to GlobalDb::_userList and to LocalRecipientList
**Address triplet (hub id, project name, user id are known)
**project id : set to -1
**Dispatching to such user, LocalRecipient::AcceptScript method:
***must not stamp delivery to this recipient
***must set a special status to the script indicating that it is waiting for project creation
* ask co-op to create a project
* when Co-op notifies Dispatcher about a change on a project list
**refresh local recipient list (co-op removed the fake entry from globalDb._userList if the enlistment was created successfully)
**start dispatching run --> the invitation script is copied to the enlistment inbox
*when Dispatcher receives OnTimer message for maintenance timer
**are there any fake entries on local recipient list?
***<i>Revisit: display UI</i>


<h2>Changes in Co-op</h2>
*remove fake entry from globalDb._userList after adding the actual user

<h2>Changes in Dispatcher</h2>
*on Dispatcher startup: <i>Revisit: display UI</i>


<h2>Successive chunks of the invitation script</h2>
When processing successive chunks of the same invitation script Dispatcher finds a correspoding user entry on the local recipient list
*if the user entry is a fake
**special processing in LocalRecipient::AcceptScript (same as in case of first chunk, see above)
*else
**copy a script to a local enlistment inbox

<h2>To Be done</h2>
*handling more than 1 invitations "at the same time"
**OnTimer message for maintenance timer caused by processing of first invitation script may happen right after filling Join dialog for a successive invitation script when co-op had no time to process the successive request. This is why we need to associate with every invitation script a time when Dispatcher asks co-op to create enlistment. On maintenence timer only invitation scripts for which half a minute passed are processed.

<h2>Questions</h2>
*What happens if a script to an invited user arrives before invitation?? A local hub does not even know whether it is going to be a local project or a satellite project.
** at least add "I am expecting invitation to this project" option to Unknown recipient wizard.
