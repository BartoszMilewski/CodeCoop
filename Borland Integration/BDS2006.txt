SCC API integration:

Based on survey results that said it wasn't widely used and the amount 
of work required to fix bugs, test, and add C++ support; a decision 
was made to deliver the existing (Delphi 2005) SCC API support in 
DeXter but not register it so it won't be visible or an official part 
of the product.

There will be instructions added to the documentation on how to get to it if 
you want to use it.
