$&PRICE;. 

License installation information:

If you haven't done it yet, download the latest version 5.0 Lite from ftp://ftp.relisoft.com/co-opLite.exe (this license will not work with Code Co-op Pro, so if you've been using a Pro trial version, you have to overwrite it -- no data will be lost). Install this exe over your existing installation of Code Co-op. Command-line applets can be downloaded from ftp://ftp.relisoft.com/cmdline.exe.
 
Input the license information exactly as shown below in each installation of Code Co-op.  This is done by running Code Co-op and selecting Program > License.  The following licensee name and alpha-numeric license key must be entered exactly as shown below.  This key will unlock the time limit and make you fully licensed for &COOP_SEATS; workstations/enlistments.
 
Licensee name: &LICENSEE_NAME;
License key:   &LICENSE_KEY;
